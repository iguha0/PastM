Booking your Van

Unless you're moving a very short distance and can do many hops in your own transport - or if you're moving with a group of people (such as in the Military), or your family has access to a suitable van, its important to book your van as far in advance as possible, to allow you to ensure that you get your van.
 
You can collect quotes online based on your move date and expected destination - and the phone and confirm and discuss these quotes if necessary.  During this phone call, you can also ask about anything you've got concerns about, if anything.

 You'll need to decide whether you're moving yourself and just hiring a van, or hiring a van and moving team. Or even hiring a company to take care of it all, from packing to moving you to your new home and arranging your belongings so that you can unpack. 

You may also need some basic information on the amount of items you want to move, the sizes of your bulky items, and whether you'll be moving into a house that's up stairs or an elevator - and what access you have, as some companies charge premiums for this if you're using their team to move.   Access includes whether its a long way to your front door, or if parking is readily available, or conversely, difficult.

Booking your own van can be pretty straight forward - once you work out how large a van you need. An average four bedroom house requires around a ten tonne van, but some families have less belongings, and some have more, so its important to judge carefully and ask around rental firms for their opinion. You'll may also have to pay a deposit on your van so you should take that, and your petrol requirements into account - so that you can budget accordingly. These may or may not be included in your final price for rental, so you may need to look closely at each quote before deciding which one works for you.
