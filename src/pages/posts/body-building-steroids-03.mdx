It's understandable to want to get stacked. I am referring to ripped abs and massive arms. Many guys want and often crave this look. It's what the opposite sex has deemed manly and attractive. Although many women claim to love the "sensitive man," for some reason these guys always get dumped and left on a curb somewhere, crying. It's not a pretty sight. I've seen it before. So, many men turn to bodybuilding, sports and martial arts as a means to bulk up and get tougher. Not a bad idea! The question soon arises regarding how buff you want to become and what are you willing to do in order to reach that point. Well, now that we're on the topic, I must state that one specific thing you DO NOT want to do is resort to body building steroids. This is merely a lame route of ancient bodybuilders. 

It's often discussed how terrible drugs are. You can read about it in the paper or maybe catch a story on tonight's local news. One thing I have never heard about illegal drugs is something good they've done for a user. I've never flipped on the news and heard a story about how Brad Pitt used cocaine and it turned him into a genius, or Tom Cruise took crack and suddenly ended world hunger. Nothing great or amazing ever happens. The same can be noted about body building steroids. No athlete ever turned into Superman and became a legend for taking these drugs. Only BAD things occur. Well folks, nothing has really changed. Steroids are still horrible and should always be avoided. 

I think it's great if you're beginning a weight training program or fitness regimen. These require hard work and discipline if you plan to bulk-up. There are two sides to it and neither involves body building steroids. You have to train hard with heavy weights, and consume plenty of healthy protein and calories. If you're slim and striving to pack on 10-20 pounds of muscle, get ready for some eating. Take your body weight and multiply it times 25. There's your daily caloric intake. You may want you consume 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day. But whatever you do, avoid resorting to body building steroids. If you're looking for an edge, I recommend whey protein shakes. These are healthy and boost your immune system. And finally, if you want to some extra power, you can always give creatine a shot. Watch those biceps swell.
