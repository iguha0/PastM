FREE PRINTING AND MAILING

The biggest expense in the field of mail order is mailing  and
printing.  Here is a very good, accepted plan for getting 600
3x6 circulars printed and mailed FREE!

1.  Find an offset printer in your locale or by mail order who
    charges $12 or $13 per thousand for printing 100 9x12's, both
    sides.

2.  Place the following advertisement in several leading
    mailorder publications:

    1000 3x6 circulars printed for only $3. Send camera-ready     
    copy.
   
    Our non-conflicting ad on the back.  (Your name and address).

3.  On a 9x12 sheet of paper you can get six 3x6 circulars.

4.  Six orders from you advertisement nets you $18 cash.

5.  You paste your customers' camera-ready 3x6 circulars on a
    9x12 sheet of paper.

6.  You paste six of your own camera-ready 3x6 circulars on
    another 9x12 sheet of paper.  These will be printed on the
    reverse side of your customers' circulars.

7.  Both copies are then sent to the printer for printing.

8.  After printing have the printer cut out each individual 3x6
    circular apart.

9.  You will then have six 3x6 circulars, 1000 of each.

10. Package the 3x6 circulars and ship them to the proper
    customer.

11. Your customer has paid to have 1000 3X6 circulars printed. 
    He will be doing the mailing.  Your ad is printed on the      
    back.
