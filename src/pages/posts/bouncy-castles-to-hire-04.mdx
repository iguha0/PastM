There is nothing in the world the kids love more than bouncy inflatable castles.  I took my little one to a school fair lately, so I know what I'm talking about.  They had several rented kid's castles there, and all of the elementary school kids spent practically every minute they could inside jumping.  Once they got in these bouncy castles to hire, there was no stopping them, and that is that.  They just could not get enough of these bouncy castles to hire.  I can't say that I blame them.

I remember being that age, and how much joy I got from anything that would throw me up in the sky.  I love trampolines, swing sets, hanging from the monkey bars, Teeter totters, and all the other kinds of thrills for children all love.  What I love most of all, was what we called the moonwalk at the time.  Of course, nowadays, this wonderful device is called a bouncy castle to hire, but it amounts to the same thing.  Basically, bouncy castles to hire are giant inflatable platform with inflated sides and a top.  It has an air pump, continuously pumping to keep the air pressure up inside.  Once you're inside the bouncy castles to hire, you can run around, jump off the walls, slide down the slide, and have a blast in any way that you choose. I do not know who it was who invented the bouncy castles to hire, but whoever they were, they were a genius!  Why just thinking about it I get excited!  bouncy castles to hire are one of those greatest of childhood thrills, right up there beside ice cream and Halloween.

Thinking about how much joy I got out of bouncy castles to hire makes me so happy that I can share this joy with my nephew now.  Although many fads come and go, bouncy castles to hire are one of those things that will never leave.  I don't know what it is that makes them so endearing, but kids still get as much of a thrill out of them as they did when I was one.  I guess it is like they always say: the more that things change, the more that they stay the same.  The toys the kids play with are different, the clothes that they were different, but the rides that they love are every bit the same as when I was one.  I am glad that there are some things that never seem to change!
