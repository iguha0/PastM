Business ideas

I had this genius idea a year ago to look into starting my own business. I wasn't sure what I wanted or was even interested in, but I knew that I just wanted something. I bought two magazines that were supposedly filled with business ideas. I thought that at least one of the business ideas would interest me. I raced home and after dinner that evening, I dove into reading them. To be honest, I was greatly disappointed. There were some great business ideas that have been successful for people, however, none of them interested me in the least. My personal favorites were from people who were bragging about how rich they were and promised me that I could make thousands and thousands of dollars a week. For a small fee, usually $39.00, I could contact them for information and get started to earning my own riches. Whoever came up with those business ideas definitely knew how to get my attention. The problem was, they didn't know enough to keep my attention for more than a few moments. There were six ads in each 
magazine that were based on the same business ideas. I admit, I was intrigued. I was even tempted to try it just out of curiosity. Instead, I did some research. I'm not one of those individuals out there who leaps before they think. I like to know what I'm getting into.

I logged onto the Better Business Bureau website and checked out every single one of the companies advertising their get rich quick business ideas. I was not surprised to see that every single one of them had numerous complaints and bad reputations. I guess their business ideas weren't so brilliant afterall. Many of the complaints that had been recorded were from people who said that the company was a scam and that they had issues even getting their initial fee back even though it claimed they had a 100% money back guarantee. I guess their business ideas were only about making money for themselves. 

Most of the other business ideas that were in the so-called reputable magazines were either boring or sounded pretty risky. I was happy to see that some of the ads actually told readers what their start up costs would be. It was the companies, like the get rich quick ones, that never mentioned what you will be doing to earn your riches. It is a shame that more people don't take the time to question things like that before sending their money and getting their hopes up. Don't just fall for business ideas that sound too good to be true, because they most likely are. Think about it, if those business ideas really worked as well as they claim too, there would be more people taking advantage of them and quitting their old jobs. But, that isn't happening. 

I gave up my quest for business ideas and stuck to my day job. There were too many business ideas that were in existence and I didn't really know what I wanted. Maybe someday. But, if you are looking into business ideas - take the time to do your research. Save yourself some trouble and make sure it is legit.
