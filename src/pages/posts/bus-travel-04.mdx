Bus Travel

Bus travel is one of the most underrated ways to get somewhere. Although a lot of people prefer to travel by plane, I have always liked traveling by bus. When you traveled by bus, you get a chance to take it slow. You see the scenes and sites around the country, talk to the people around you, and relax and let the driver do the work. You don't have to deal with the hassle of airport security, and you certainly don't have to pay airport prices.

I like to travel by bus and train because I like to not worry about getting there quickly. Sometimes, you miss the connection or your bus breaks down and you have to take a little bit longer. It doesn't matter, however, because there are always people to talk to and the prices are low enough that you can afford to be a little bit late. Anyway, bus travel is a lot more reliable than it used to be. Out of a good 50 bus trips in the past two years, I have only run into two breakdowns that cost a serious amount of time. 

One of the things that you have to keep in mind about bus travel is that your bags are your responsibility. It isn't like the airlines at all. When you buy airline tickets, you check your bags at the gate and pick them up when you leave. The airline make sure that they get there safely with a reasonably high rate of success. With bus travel, however, you might want to keep an eye on your bags when you change buses. When there is a change, the bus drivers will load and unload bags that are scheduled to be moved. It is easy for them to miss yours if you don't keep an eye open. I've had it happen to me more than once, and it can be a big hassle. Nonetheless, it is easy to avoid as long as you make sure to get out of the bus and watch what the driver is doing.

Greyhound bus travel is by far the most popular kind. In most of the country, they run the majority of the buses. Part of it is quality and part of it is brand name recognition. When people think about cross-country bus travel, they automatically picture a Greyhound bus. I've been in more of their buses than American Coachways or any of the other companies
