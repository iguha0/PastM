The Boyds Collection Ltd., started life as an antique shop in 1979 in the heart of rural Maryland in the town of Boyds. Boyds Collectibles, as they came to be known, are a large outlet for stuffed animals and other products, mostly with a teddy bear theme. The merchandise is bought for babies, children and adults who are collectors or who want to brighten up their home.

The company is now based in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania where there is a store, a restaurant and a free museum with information on the history of Boyds Collectibles. Items can be bought online too and there is something for every occasion. The web site has a search facility for customers to find their nearest dealer. Christmas Holiday Bears are dressed as Santa Claus and there are also elf bears and penguins in the festive spirit. Graduation can be celebrated with a special bear or owl, dressed in cap and gown and Valentine's Day bears include a bear couple, dressed as a bride and groom.

The bears are bean filled and are hand made from the best materials. They can be personalized with a message. There are a wide range of plush bears, dressed in various costumes and hats. Figurines are popular too and make lovely ornaments for the home. Many people buy them as presents and they are attractively gift boxed. One of the lines includes spiritual figures of angels, sprites and praying bears. For sports fans, there are novelty bears, dressed in football shirts or sitting on top of a golf ball.

Decorative teddy bear themed items are also in the Boyds Collectibles range, including pillows, desk signs and family plaques. Bear lovers can do their shopping with tote bags with bear motifs. There are also figurines for the garden in the form of bears and snowmen. Bears also adorn decorated stepping stones.

The company has set up a home party program called Bear Home Reunions. These events are designed for customers to look at the products in the relaxed environment of the home. Bear Advisors visit a home where the hostess supplies refreshments. The Advisors bring examples of the merchandise on offer in addition to the product catalog. The home parties can also take place in the workplace or other suitable place where people can gather together. The Boyds Collectibles parties are social occasions for bear lovers as well as business opportunities!
