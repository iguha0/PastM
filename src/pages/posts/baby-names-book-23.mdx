Baby Names Book

Choosing a name for the new arrival can be quite a daunting task, especially if the parents can't agree.  Many people select family names and that can cause tension amongst the in-laws. A baby names book may help the choice and they make interesting reading, with regard to learning about the meanings and origins of names. For anyone who's having difficulties, spare a thought for couples expecting sextuplets!

To give examples of names and their meanings, the following is a brief selection; Ann signifies grace and is Hebrew in origin, Gloria is Latin for glory, Patricia means noble from the English and Tara means tower originating from the Celtic. Barnard means big bear from the English, Keiran is small and dark and is Celtic, Sebastian means venerable from the Greek and Toby translates, as God is good from old English. A baby names book from different countries will show that names have equivalent versions in several languages e.g. Pablo, a common Spanish name is Paul in English. Sean or Shaun is a Celtic version of John.

Some parents choose a name for sentimental reasons, perhaps from the place of conception. That's fine if you are Brooklyn Beckham, son of David and Victoria Beckham.  It's not so good if you were conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas! Unusual names can be a burden for some kids but they may appreciate it more when they reach teenage years and yearn for individuality. 

Celebrities are well known for going against the norm. Some famous parents have certainly not consulted a baby names book. Their quest for something different has led to some bizarre choices. Nicholas Cage decided to call his son by the Krypton name of Superman, Kal-El. He'll get a shock if junior starts flying around. Cher and Sonny Bono named their daughter Chastity,  (no pressure) and David Bowie thought that his son would revel in being called Zowie Bowie. The most out there of baby names has to be the choices of Bob Geldof and the late Paula Yates. Their daughters were named Fifi-Trixibelle, Peaches Honeyblossom and Pixie. Not ideal names for a tough schoolyard. 

Popular names change over the years and different ones go in and out of favor. It's interesting to compare a baby names book from today and from many years ago. The most popular boy names in America in 2005 were Jacob, Michael, Joshua and Matthew. Compare that list with the 1880s and we have John, William, Charles and George. As for the girls, 2005 lists Emily, Emma, Madison and Abigail. The 1880s shows Mary, Anna, Elizabeth and Margaret. It's clear that biblical names are holding their own in this age of obsessions with celebrity.
