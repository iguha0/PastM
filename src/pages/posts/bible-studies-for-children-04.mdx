Throughout our entire lives the devil who try to contest and trick us into accepting his lies as the truth.   Although we can fall for these lies at any age, we are never more susceptible to them than when we are young.  Without the proper guidance, children barely know the difference between right and wrong, and even if they do their often too weak to remember it and to do the right thing.   This is why having the right children's Bible lessons is so important.  As good, God-fearing parents, it is our responsibility to make sure I children know God's truth and can distinguish it from Satan's lies.  The only way to ask scratch that the only way to effectively do that is by using Bible studies for children.

A lot of adults do not understand the importance of Bible studies for children.  They think that, since there is only one Bible and that is the word of God, why should there be multiple types of Bible lessons? I completely understand this perspective.  After all, that is what I used to think! But the thing that I did not realize, and the thing that you do not realize, is that the Bible studies for children
are only useful if they are understood.  The fact is that there are a lot of things that adults understand that children cannot.  Bible studies for children need to be designed with their level of comprehension in mind.  If the kids can not understand what they are reading, after all, what is the point? The kids Bible studies, you see, like any Bible studies, and not the literal word of God but rather a teaching of the word of God.  While the word of God never changes, and should never be changed, the way that it is read in the way that it is understood must be changed so that people can understand it correctly.

Of course, the best Bible studies for children often come from the people who are teaching them.  If you are teaching the Bible to your own children, you are in a unique position to understand what they get and what they do not.  You can also understand what they need to learn.  If you can incorporate the right Bible studies for children into the teaching program that you set up for your own kids, they will not only learn the Bible, but good behavior as well.
