Air Travel:  Is It Right for You?

Are you interested in taking a vacation?  If you are, you may be required to fly.  There are many popular vacation destinations, such as Hawaii, Europe, and the Caribbean, that cannot be reached any other way.  With that in mind, if you are looking to vacation within in the United States you may have more options.  For that reason, you may want to first decide if traveling by airplane is really right for you.

When it comes to determining if air travel is really right for you, for your next trip, you will first want to look at your destination.  Just because you do not have any oceans to cross, it does not mean that you donâ€™t need to fly.  For example, if you are looking to travel from New York to California, it may be within your best interest to fly.  This is particularly true if you are limited on the amount of vacation time that you have available from your work.  

Your budget is another factor that you will want to take into consideration, when trying to determine if air travel is right for you.  For example, there are many other cheaper alternatives for those who must travel a short to medium distance.  For example, if you will be traveling from Texas to Nevada, you may be able to buy tickets for a bus or train.  There are many different options when you look for them.  For many individuals, riding a bus or a train is a much more affordable option.  Perhaps, the only downside to this approach is the time that you will spend on the road.  For many, it would just be convenient to drive their own car.

Speaking of driving your own car, if you are looking to avoid flying, you will want to examine your alternative option of driving yourself.  As previously stated, keep your location and distance in mind.  Also, it is important to take the cost of your trip into consideration.  Many of us automatically think of gasoline and the cost of it, but it is also important to take the cost of vehicle wear and tear into consideration.  For that reason, many end up renting a car for their trip.  However, it is important to return back to traveling by air.  For long distance trips, the cost of renting a car can be the same, if not more than hopping on a flight that only lasts a few hours

What does all of this mean for you?  It does mean that you will likely be better off traveling by airplane if you are looking to travel in the United States.  With that said, there are some exceptions to this rule.  For example, you should never fly if you can drive to your destination in an hour or two, as doing so can be considered a waste of money.  Also, if you are a motor home owner or if you can find an affordable rental nearby, you may want to drive to your destination instead, as doing so can sometimes be better than flying.

For the most part, the only individuals who should have trouble flying are those who suffer from claustrophobia or a fear of flying, even flying is safe.  Individuals with other disabilities, including the need of an oxygen tank or those who are wheel chair bound, can still fly to their destination, as many airlines will go out of their way to provide needed accommodations and services.
