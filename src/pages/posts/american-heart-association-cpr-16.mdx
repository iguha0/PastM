Nothing prepares you for a serious crisis quite like American Heart Association CPR training. Many individuals take a quick course to get CPR certification through this program each and every year. Certification needs to be renewed every 12 months in order for it to remain valid.

The American Heart Association CPR certification program helps individuals to learn the steps of proper culinary pulmonary respiration during an emergency.

If you answer at least 98 out of 100 questions correctly and demonstrate the steps to American Heart Association CPR process on a dummy, you could be re-certified in about an hour.

We never want to be in a situation that requires us to actually put CPR to use. However, it is comforting to know that you can administer the techniques if needed.
