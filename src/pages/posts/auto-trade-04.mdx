When I decided to get a new car, I really thought seriously about going to an auto trader. My car was an aging Honda. It was in great condition, and it drove like a dream. It was, however, no longer big enough for my needs. It was a two door Honda Civic, and now I had a family. I needed to do an auto trade in, but I knew how much money taxes cost. Every time you sell your car and buy another one, the government gets a cut of everything. I thought that with my cars trade-in value, if I could find the right person to take it I could simply trade cars and do away with the expenses of buying and selling.

I have a friend who is a muscle car trader, and he pointed out some good places to find used cars for sale. I picked up a Trading Times, started looking on Craigslist, and even posted some of my own ads. I figured it wouldn't be so hard to find an auto trade, but nothing seemed to be working out. Everyone I met seemed to think that their car was worth more than it was. They all wanted to get some extra cash in addition to trading their old minivan for my relatively new coupe. I just couldn't come to a deal. Finally, I realized that I would have to take advantage of the trade-in value of my car and go through a more commercial route.

I went to an auto lot and looked around. It was one of the ones my friend recommended, and sure enough there were a lot of good used car deals. When you are going to used car dealers, you have to be careful. Although not all used car sales are crooked, some of them are. There are some really bad people in the business, but if you know where to go, you can get a good deal at a fair price. As it turned out, I was able to get an auto trade that was just what I was looking for. I did have to pay a little bit of money, but I got a well working, thoroughly mechanic-certified minivan for my troubles. It actually worked for years before I had any serious problems, and by that point I had enough money to buy a brand-new car. All in all, I'm quite happy with the way my auto trade worked out.
