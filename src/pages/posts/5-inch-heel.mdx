High-heeled shoes have long been many a girls best fashion friend. Perhaps it's the added height that makes women feel elegant or maybe just because men seem to appreciate the look. 

Whatever the reason, women are shoe freaks. Shorter heels are for comfort, but tall heels are meant to be admired. So how do you choose a heel height? A recent survey showed that among women who wore high heels, most chose a 5 inch heel. Why?

For one thing, there's a practical aspect. A 5 inch heel is about 16% shorter than its 6 inch counterpart. This means the bottom of your foot is 1/6 closer to the ground! Walking in high heels is not easy. The 5 inch heel can make the difference between walking gracefully or taking a spill.

Other considerations are mostly vanity, but every woman likes to look her best. A long thin heel plays up a shapely leg, stretching the leg muscles, giving a lithe appearance.

The most popular heel today is the stilleto, recommended for those with good balance. A 5 inch heel will do the trick, for both admiring looks and walking purposes. At least with the young, the stiletto rules. It's the Business heel of shoe fashion. 

Going to an interview or power lunch? Pair some 5 inch heels with an elegant pantsuit. You get height and an elegant and confident demeanor. Platforms are a good choice as you'll have no problem walking in them for extended periods of time.

High heels are all for effect. Every woman wants to look just a bit more shapely, taller, thinner or more voluptuous than she is already. Who can blame her?

High heels can be worn to advantage with just about any ensemble. The growing trend of high heels with jeans is one example. Great with pantsuits, short and long dresses or even with shorts. If you're going to the beach, just bite the bullet and get out your sneakers.

If you haven't the confidence or balance to manage the stiletto, give the spike a try. The last shape is not so extreme as the stiletto. A 5 inch heel is again recommended, if only for the safety factor. Spike heels echo the enchanting times of classic Old Hollywood. The curvy heel compliments the curvy female form in a voluptuous effect. Ha! No man can resist this imagery.

At the other end of the high heel spectrum is the chunky heel. Now you might think this the one you wear hiking. On the contrary, men enjoy variety. The large chunky heel, by contrast, makes you look more petite. Its' squareness serves to accentuate your curves. Men even think these chunky heels make women look “cute”.

If you have a thing for shoes, there are more than enough choices. From stilettos to chunks, there's a fashion high heel that will be just right for every piece of clothing in your closet. If that shoe isn't in your closet, you may have to go shopping.
