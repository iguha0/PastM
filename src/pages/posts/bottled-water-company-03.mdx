Wouldn't it be great to own your very own company? Okay, your very own successful company. No one wants a business that's going downhill. Just think of the extra income you would accumulate; as opposed to what you earn working for someone else. Studies show that individuals who own a business achieve a better income than those who work for one. Go figure! Now, what about owning a bottled water company? That would have to bring in a fortune in this day and age. As we all can see, folks can't get enough of that liquid goodness. It's like it wasn't all that popular when it came out of the faucet in your home, but when they started sticking the stuff in bottles, look out! Oh, you want me to pay for water? Well sure; I'll take ten. What's up with this craze? It would be a heck of a lot cheaper to simply buy a cool water bottle and fill it yourself each day. 

Some companies, businesses and franchises undoubtingly pay off. These days if you're dealing with a coffee house or a bottled water company, then you're pretty much good to go. Now, you can't really dispute this. It's as clear as the water they're selling. Go into any convenient store and take a look at the beverage coolers. How many kinds of bottled water are in there? Typically I see Evian, Dasani, and Aquafina. These must be the top three. One is produced by Coca Cola, one by the Pepsi Company, and the other is some French thing. The funny part is that folks think the French Evian is the best one. Well I tried this stuff and it has a funky taste to it. Hmm, it must be cowardice. After all, this is the country that ditched us at the last minute after the 911 tragedy. Why do we even act like we like them? We know they don't like us. Therefore, Americans should go for the American owned bottled water company. Support our great nation; not theirs. 

Ahh, there's nothing quite like a nice cold swig of clean water. This is the beverage of our health. It's our liquid life-source; so chug it down. Don't fret about which bottled water company is the most popular. Just look for one that's rated well and doesn't cost a fortune, like that French garbage does. Buy American water and be proud you did.
