Bladder Infection Remedies

Anyone who has ever had a bladder infection or urinary tract infection (UTI) knows, the pain and discomfort can be unbearable, and in some cases have very serious consequences. Also known as “honeymoon cystitis”, bladder infections can involve the bladder, kidneys, ureters, and the urethra, and are extremely common in women; recurrent bladder infections are usually caused by sex with a new partner, not emptying bladder when the need arises, excess sugar consumption, and not drinking enough water. There are quite a few natural bladder infection remedies available to prevent and treat the discomfort, but if symptoms are extreme, antibiotics are the best option to get the symptoms under control. 

The most common symptoms of a bladder infection are frequent urge to urinate, passing only small quantities of urine, burning, painful urination, cloudy, milky, or red urine, and pain or pressure in the abdomen or lower back. If fever, nausea, vomiting, or chills are present, the infection has most likely spread to the kidneys (Pyelonephritis), which requires immediate treatment with antibiotics to prevent any damage from occurring. According to www.healthynet,.com, antibiotics are not the only solution to curing bladder infections. Drink, drink, drink!!! Lots of water and cranberry juice are effective bladder infection remedies in the prevention and adjunct treatment of UTIs. Reoccurrence is significantly reduced by consuming cranberry juice and cranberry capsules; according to repeated research results, cranberry juice has been used for more than a century to successfully treat recurrent and acute episodes.

There is a lot of good comprehensive information on the symptoms and treatment of UTIs and natural bladder infection remedies available online. According to numerous internet sources, cranberries are the most common of the natural bladder infection remedies, but there are also various homeopathic treatments that are specific for certain symptoms. For instance, if extreme bladder pain and blood in the urine is present, Cantharis (Spanish Fly) is recommended. Sarsaparilla for burning pain in the urethra at the end of urination, Staphysagria (Stavesacre) for “honeymoon cystitis”, or Berberis aquifolium (Oregon grape) for right sided kidney pain. Other natural remedies include goldenseal, marshmallow root, buchu, corn silk, horsetail, and the little heard of herb, uva ursi. Sources also state that relief with homeopathic bladder infection remedies should occur within twelve hours, and again, if symptoms are severe, seek medical attention immediately. An acute urinary tract infection is nothing to mess around with. Pyelonephritis requires hospitalization and an aggressive antibiotic regimen to be treated successfully.
