On our downtime, we love having a little fun. Most of us work all day long and when we get home, having something relaxing to do is really welcomed. If you want a change from video games and television, consider an air hockey table. This addictive, fast-paced game brings out the competitive side in just about everyone who plays it. You also don’t need to be the next Wayne Gretzky to master it. In fact, no ice skating is required at all.

This games table is the perfect addition to any household. Kids can play it and have friends over. It will keep them occupied for hours. They can set up tournaments that run everyday after school or even all weekend long. You can get an air hockey table designed in different colors so it matches the already existent décor you’ve got in your home. If you have a classy house filled with lots of expensive art, a big baby blue and red air hockey table is going to stand out. However, if you have one with a nice wood finish and black trim it’ll look perfect in your home but still has the function of being a fun game.

Adults love this game as well. If you’re a bachelor, this would be perfect for you when your buddies come over for either a chill, relaxing evening or preparing for a big night out. An air hockey table is smaller than a billiards table which saves more room but they are just as energetic, if not more. Don’t be surprised if your guests are lining up to play once they see how much fun it really is. 

The nicer the table, the more expensive it will be. The price can range anywhere from $300 to $4000. It depends mainly on what kind of style you want it and how many extras you want. Some have 3 in 1 games which will of course cost more money. If you’ve got kids in the home, the tables with several games included are a good buy as they’ll keep the children’s interest for years.

Setting them up isn’t complicated at all. You’ll definitely need a helper though to help steady the pieces as you put them together. Be sure you place the table on a level spot in the home. 

You will never again get bored if you have one of these in your house. Everyone can play and it helps to pass the time on a rainy day and through the chilly months of winter. An air hockey table is suitable for any household. Just make sure you always have someone to challenge you and your skills at this game.
