Sometimes, there is nothing better in the summer than sitting out in the sun. Setting out your beach chair by the ocean, sipping cool drinks, and reading a book under an umbrella are some of the greatest pleasures that summer has to offer. Beach chairs are much more comfortable than lying on a beach towel, and they keep the sand out of your picnic supplies and bathing suit.  

One of the great things about a beach chair is that you can use it at home as well as at the beach. This summer, in fact, my girlfriend and I have started a new tradition. You see, we originally bought beach chairs to take out to the seashore. It is, however, about two hours drive to get to the ocean â€“ something that is a little overwhelming for your average Sunday outing. 

We try to go at least once or twice a month, but on the weekends when we can't, we still like to enjoy the sun. We simply set up a beach chair in my backyard, lie out with a good book, and enjoy soaking up some rays. To be honest, although there is no ocean nearby, I enjoy it almost as much just glad being in the backyard. We have a nice little courtyard, filled with flowers and vegetables. Hummingbirds flutter by every once in a while, and butterflies are also frequent visitors to the garden. It just goes to show you, sometimes the most pleasant environments are right where you live.

Of course, a beach chair requires little bit more portability than your average outdoor recliner. When you are picking one out to carry to the beach, finding one that can be easily transported is one of the most important issues. Believe me, it is really a letdown to buy a new recliner, only to realize that you can't fit it in the car along with the kids, the picnic, the beach ball, and the rubber raft. Just because you have to find a portable one, however, doesn't mean you can't find a good one. Many of the best beach chairs are actually extremely collapsible. If you can find one of the fancy canvas and metal models, you can fold it down smaller than a typical folding chair and stick it in the back of the car. Although it might cost a bit of money, it is definitely worth it for the convenience of being able to take it with you on the road.
