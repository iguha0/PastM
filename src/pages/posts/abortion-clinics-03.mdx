There are many difficult decisions we make in our lives. It's easy to say that one of the greatest ones commonly concerns children. You either decide to have them or you don't. For me it's that simple. The last thing I think a woman or couple should do is have a child and raise him/her poorly. This is never prudent, nor does it ever go well. Children require unconditional love, and if you know that you're too selfish to give it to them, then don't have kids. My brother completely admits that he and his wife are way too selfish to have children. They want to do what they want to do, and they don't want to deal with kids getting in the way. There is nothing wrong with this. Some people were meant to have children and some were not. Every couple on the planet certainly doesn't need to. If we had more thinking going on regarding this topic, there would be less abortion clinics. 

You can easily find abortion clinics in this day and age. I know what you're thinking. This is always an extremely touchy subject. Some folks are Pro-Choice and others are Pro-Life. Me, I'm somewhere in the middle of it all. It's kind of like Republican and Democrat. I have trouble choosing a side because I have mixed feelings and opinions. It's never that black and white for me. For example, I do think abortion clinics are necessary sometimes. We clearly have oodles of crime in our harsh society. If a woman is raped and becomes pregnant, there is no way I would tell her to have the child. What if it's a 13 year old girl and her father is the one who got her pregnant? Would you actually insist on her giving birth? Situations like these are a mess, and they're very sensitive. In my opinion these are the situations that require abortion clinics. Of course there are a few individuals out there who say that abortion is wrong no matter what. Although I sort of see their perspective, I have to wonder if they would say the same thing if it were them. 

Find out all you want to know about abortion and where abortion clinics are located by getting online. Take a gander at the contemporary debates regarding this sensitive issue. However, always remember to keep an open mind. Not all of us are going to see eye to eye.
