Algebra Homework

The day my daughter comes to me for help with her algebra homework will be the day she realizes that mom might not be the smartest person on the planet. Though most children find out their parents don’t actually know everything, most parents don’t know when this day will come. I know, however, and I am certain this will be the day. I know that algebra homework will be my downfall. I’m not a stupid person, not by any means, but when it comes to math, you can forget it. If someone starts talking about numbers, I warn them that it sounds like math to me, and they should that they are about to lose my interest.

It’s not that I have anything against math. It’s highly useful and absolutely necessary. I just can’t do advanced math for some reason. I’m ok with the basics, but if you put an algebra problem in front of me, you can forget it. When I was in high school, algebra homework often brought on headaches, and upon occasion, a few tears. Perhaps I just had a bad teacher, I don’t know, but for some reason even the basics of algebra didn’t make any sense. Perhaps if I had a better teacher or a tutor to help, I might not feel the same right now. But as it stands, algebra homework is the mainstay in some of my worst high school memories.

They day my daughter comes home with her algebra homework, she will figure out my secret. I’ll feel bad about disappointing her, but she will have her dad to help her out. He can do math well, and it won’t be a problem for him to assist her with her algebra homework, and perhaps even chemistry or geometry as well. If she ends up taking calculus, I’ll be proud of her, but it’s going to be up to him to help her out.  

If your child is having trouble with algebra homework, and you are like me and you are unable to help, you can find help for your child at school. Have them talk to their teacher for extra help, or find someone to come after school to tutor them. A tutor to help with algebra homework may cost you, but it’ll be a good investment for your child. You don’t want them to feel as helpless as I do when it comes to algebra or other types of complicated math and theories.
