Online Dating Safety For Men


Almost everything you read about online dating safety is directed at women but men need to be concerned as well.  Perverts, sexual predators and weirdoes come in both sexes, all sizes, and all ages…as do, liars and cheaters.  So men need to stay on guard, too.  

It is common knowledge not to readily give out personal information to strangers.  The reason for not doing so is as large as the number of strangers who want that information.  If you come across a person who is giving out personal information and asking others to do the same, don’t do it.  You don’t know what they want to use it for….and you had better believe they want to use it for something.  That “something” will not be for your benefit.  Men, also, need to guard their real names, addresses, phone numbers, and place of employment.  Do not give that information to anyone online until you are confident that they are who they say they are.

Men, be wary of women who seem too financially needy.  If they ask for money, in any of a dozen ways women can ask for money, cut the relationship off immediately.  They are not looking for love or even friendship….they are looking for financial help.  

If a woman gives you a contact number but you cannot ever reach her at that number, beware.  If you always have to page them or text them and have them call you back, this could be a sign that what they are telling you is not the complete truth.  

A need to get married and insecurity are other signs men should be very wary of.  If the woman is pushing too hard for a commitment you aren’t ready to make, it might be a good time to head for the nearest exit.
