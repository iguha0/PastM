Buying Advertising

No matter how big or how small your business may be you will always have to advertise to get customers in the door. A rare business might be able to operate on word of mouth alone, but that is a rarity indeed. For the most part, buying advertising should be something that is part of your monthly budget, and even when things are ticking over rather well you should still advertise. You can never have too much exposure, and you always need to attract new customers.

When you first start buying advertising, you probably have to start small, though there is not rule that says you have to. Many start buying advertising in local newspapers and they may try to snag a few cheap radio spots. The more you have in your budget for advertising, the more spots or ads you can take out. Those who neglect to put aside any money for advertising are the ones who tend to end up going out of business rather quickly, so give it all you can.

If you have more in your budget, you should think about buying advertising on television. There is a huge difference buying advertising on network television and buying time from your local cable network. My cable provider is Time Warner, and I always see ads telling consumers they can buy ad time for a low price through them, and you may find your local cable provider can offer you this as well.

The most important part of buying advertising is knowing where to place it. If you have a garden supply shop, you will want to get spots on related cable channels like HGTV or the like. If you have something that everyone uses, such as a new grocery store, you can advertise almost anywhere you want. If you are buying advertising for a new daycare, you may want to advertise in the daytime hours. Moms thinking about going back to work are more likely to see your ad at this time than in the evening hours, though really, both are not bad ideas.

If you are buying advertising for television, but you don’t know what or where you want to put your ads for the best results, you should ask for assistance. Those you buy your advertising from should be able to help you place your ad in the most effective place you can afford with your advertising budget. It’s not as hard as you may think, and there is always someone out there who can help you out if you need them.
