Welcome to the age of supplements! If you're not currently on some sort of diet plan, then I'd be surprised. It just seems like everyone is trying something. Whether or not we're all trying the rights plans remains to be seen. As for me, I guess I wouldn't say I'm on a diet exactly. My eating regime has more to do with protein and calories. I want a lot of both. Now, who says I want to run back and forth to the refrigerator every two hours for more food? This is annoying and completely interrupts my day. What I need is something more along the lines of quick and convenient health food supplements. Take Atkins bars, Pure Protein, and GNC supplement meals for example. These are simple and don't interrupt my day. 

The world of supplements and protein/energy bars is vast. There is no doubt that it can be difficult to find exactly what you're looking for. Sure, you can easily find a product; but is it the right one? It's not just about running to a health food store and snagging a few Atkins bars. It's about narrowing down the supplements that offer the nutrients and benefits you're searching for. And that's not all! Then there's the taste issue. Believe me when I inform you that many health food supplements taste BAD. Whether or not you feel this way about Atkins bars or Cliff bars is up to you and your taste buds. It certainly varies from person to person. I recall the first time I tried Pure Protein bars. This is a supplement food that's quick and easy on the go, and offers about 20 grams of protein per serving, but without a load of carbs. Sounds ideal, right? Well, in my opinion the taste is far from ideal. Even though I've heard raving reviews about these bars and their phenomenal good taste, I don't agree. I think they taste pasty and dense. Nothing like what I expected. 

So what's on your agenda? Are you in need of a few Pure Protein or Atkins bars for high protein and low carb intake? Or, are you looking more for an all-round meal supplement bar like Met-RX has to offer in their Colossal 100? Either way, you definitely won't have trouble finding either one. Nutrition stores provide everything from Atkins bars to whey protein shakes. Take advantage of the supplements, folks!
