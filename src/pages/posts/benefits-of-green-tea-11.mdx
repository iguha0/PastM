Benefits of Green Tea

Health minded individuals look to natural alternatives to fight off illness and chronic disease, and enhance general well being. One of the most popular natural food choices is green tea because of its known health benefits. Green tea is derived from the same plant as black tea, they are just processed differently. According to various online sources, green tea contains polyphenols, collectively known as catechins, which are powerful antioxidants shown in recent studies to fight viruses, slow aging, and fight free radicals that can damage cells and leave the body susceptible to cancer and other diseases. Some other benefits of green tea: lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels, reduces angiotensin II levels that affect blood pressure, fights allergies, and strengthens the immune system. As you can see, there are many healthy benefits associated with regular consumption of green tea.
