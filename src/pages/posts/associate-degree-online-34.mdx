I completed a four year Bachelor’s of Arts degree from a liberal arts college.  It was close to ten thousand dollars per year for tuition after subtracting my grants and scholarships, and that was not including room and board!  I did not even live at college, yet I was paying that much money.  And you know what?  I could have gotten an associate degree online and been in just about the same place after graduation with my communications degree.

I took a few online courses from a community college to complete some credits towards my degree during the summer.  This led me to find out about their associate degree online program.  The program was only a few hundred dollars per semester because it was a community college and they were not paying for a classroom being used.  They still had to pay a professor to assign readings and upload tests, but the costs were significantly cheaper for those that were obtaining their associate degree online rather than through the traditional classroom setting.

If you are considering getting an associate degree online, it is great for several reasons.  The main reason, though, is that if you are doing this while you do not have a flexible schedule, such as if you are working full time or have small children at home, you are able to complete assignments and “take” the classes at any time during the day.  You can log in at midnight and earn your credits for your associate degree online.  There are no colleges that I am aware of that would offer traditional classes at that hour, but if this is the only time of day you are available for classes, then this is an excellent alternative.

Getting an associate degree online is not for everyone.  You truly have to be motivated to complete the task, otherwise it is very easy to forget about the classes and fall very far behind.  Also, if you are a person that needs hands on teaching methods and a professor available immediately rather than through email, then getting your associate degree online may not be the best option for you.

If you are looking into going to college, be sure to check into all the options that are available to you.  Sure there are the traditional four year degrees from colleges and universities, but check out what is available in the forms of associate degrees and an associate degree online if you are looking to save money and get a degree to build off of.
