Booking a Removal Company

When booking a removal company, its important to do so as far in advance of your move date as possible - removal firms who do all of the packing and moving for you expect to be able to come out and assess your belongings, for insurance and van/person ell cover. 

It’s important to de-clutter, or have a guesstimate of how much you'll have de-cluttered before you move so that they can give you an accurate quote.  If you overestimate the space you need, you'll not get a refund, and find that space is wasted – especially, if you book a larger van than you require.  Too small and you may find that your belongings don't fit, or that you get charged extra.  You also might not get to move that day, if they have to unload one van and reload another, or book another transport for your belongings.

Allowing a company to pack your belongings isn't without risk, so before you hire a removal firm be sure to check their credentials and references thoroughly. You'll have items you don't want them to pack - make sure you pack them yourself, or tell them, clearly what you expect them to pack and not pack. Its always good to take an inventory before allowing anyone to come in and pack your belongings - and if you can, take photos. 

Most companies provide insurance and are consummate professionals, but some can cause more damage than the cost of hiring them, and its important to have redress when moving belongings. Their insurance should be carefully examined to make sure it covers everything - this will also give you an idea of what they will and won't pack - and what extras (such as mattress covering) they'll provide. Companies can come in and pack your house in as little as two days - so its important to know what to expect and when to expect them. You will want to stay and watch them packing (and possibly pack some of your own things) so make sure to allow for that when planning your move.
