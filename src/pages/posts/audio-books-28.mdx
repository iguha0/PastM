Audio books

I love to read. I love reading anything and everything that comes in my direction. The problem is; I don’t have time to sit down and open up a book as much as I used to. Every morning, I have a forty-five minute commute to work. On the way home, my commute often will take a full hour. A good friend of mine, who also is a huge fan of reading, told me that I should borrow one of her audio books and try it out on one of my commutes. While I wasn’t too keen on the idea of having to listen to a story, I agreed. I let it sit in my car for several days before even attempting to listen to it. I just thought that the idea of someone reading me a story seemed so childish. Finally, four days after she loaned it to me, I found myself sitting in construction. Bored and frustrated, I decided to try it. Within five minutes, I found myself so absorbed in one of my favorite author’s stories, that I lost track of time. I listened to it the entire rest of my drive to work and finished it on my way home from work.

When I returned it to her the following weekend, I asked to borrow a few more. Since falling in love with the idea of keeping up to date on all of the books that I’ve been missing out on, I’ve taken to buying and renting audio books frequently. At first, I purchased all of the audio books that I wanted. It added up way too fast. I joined a book club and got audio books at a decent discounted price, which thrilled me. I checked out my local library and would borrow some audio books for a week. Their selection was not as great as what I would like, but you can’t beat something that doesn’t cost a single cent. 
Before too long, my boring commutes to work were no longer boring. I found myself completely absorbed in my audio books. Interestingly enough, I had thought that someone reading to me wouldn’t be very appealing but instead, I found that the tone of voices that the narrator would use could be very engaging. Their interpretations and readings of certain events within a story could make me think differently than I may have read the same event in a book. 

If you love to read and simply don’t have the time to finish a book from start to finish, make your commute or travels a bit more enjoyable and get yourself some audio books. Whether you purchase them from a bookstore, join a book club to get them at a discounted price or find them at your local library, you’ll find that it is worth every single penny.
