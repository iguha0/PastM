The benefits of magnesium are unknown to many of us. This mineral is neglected by most people. This is obvious because over 90 percent of us don’t get the recommended daily allowance of this mineral in our diets. This may not seem like a big deal to many but the benefits of magnesium are often overlooked until we consider the symptoms of a deficiency.

If you notice a combination of the following symptoms you may not be reaping the many benefits of magnesium. A deficiency can be the cause of uncomfortable leg cramps that wake you from your sleep. These spasms are quite painful and they can really disrupt your ability to move as well as your sleeping patterns.

The benefits of magnesium that are often ignored may keep you from feeling fatigue and even depression. These symptoms are not commonly associated with a mineral deficiency at all and they may not help an individual realize that his diet needs supplementation. We don’t usually point our fingers at the lack of magnesium as a possible cause for depression and fatigue but they can be caused by this deficiency. 

A person who has a severe deficiency will notice a loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms only make the condition worse because the body loses the nutrients that it so desperately needs. It is impossible to reap the benefits of magnesium if you are unable to ingest foods that contain the mineral into your system. 

High blood pressure and migraines are two other symptoms that are not commonly associated with magnesium. However, some of the benefits of magnesium include properties that help people maintain a healthy blood pressure reading and they can ward off painful migraines. 

What are the actual benefits of magnesium other than keeping the symptoms of a deficiency at bay? This mineral is useful in keeping the body’s heart in good condition. The mineral supplies this muscle with nutrients that it needs to run smoothly. This helps the body maintain a healthy blood pressure level as well.

The supplement is also useful in helping the body absorb other mineral as well. Minerals like calcium and potassium cling to the magnesium and are pulled into the body. Calcium is helpful in building strong bones and potassium helps the body regulate muscles. When there is a lack of potassium there is a reoccurrence of leg cramps. 

The benefits of magnesium may not be quite so easy to describe. However, the importance of this mineral is evident when a body does not get enough of it.
