If you have children, one sure why to make sure they have fun at any party or any gathering is to have a bubble machine. These can be a lot of fun, and though they are often used at clubs and at concerts, they can also be used in the home for special occasions. For some reason, children are fascinated with bubbles, and they hold their attention for a long time. A great birthday party can be even better if you have one of these.

A bubble machine does just what you might think. It produces bubble after bubble as long as it has bubble fluid inside. These can be used indoors and out, but there are some safety issues to consider. If you use them indoors, they can be rather slippery if they are used for a long period of time. Even children with sneakers on can slip if too much of the fluid is on the floor. Otherwise, they are very safe and very easy to use. When using these outside, they are safe on concrete areas, but might make a slicker surface even more slippery. Grass should work fine in most cases, without any accidents, at least from the bubbles. 

What is even better is that a bubble machine is usually very inexpensive, even for the ones meant for professional uses like concerts and for DJs. You can usually get a decent one for under fifty bucks, and in some cases, for under thirty. When buying, make sure you take into account how they work. The ones that take batteries are portable, but they may run through the batteries rather quickly. Instead, you may want to get one that has a power plug so you won’t have to worry about replacing the batteries all of the time.

You can find a bubble machine that is small and made just for individual use. This size might be great for the child in the bathtub or playing out in the backyard. Think about the safety of slippery soap - as with the professional type though. You might also want to be sure the type of bubbles you get won’t leave rings on your paint job. You might want to get one online if you have specifics in mind, as they usually come with very thorough descriptions so you know you are getting the right one for your needs. You can also get your bubbles at the same time, and order as much or as little as you think you need.
