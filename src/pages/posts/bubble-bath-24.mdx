Bubble Bath

My daughter loves to take a bubble bath. Most kids do, and it is not something we outgrow when we get older. I have even caught my husband taking a bubble bath, though he claims it was an accident. I’m not sure how you can accidentally pour bubbles into your bath, but I decided to let it go and not laugh too hard. There is nothing wrong with a man taking a bubble bath; it was just funny how hard he was trying to hide it. Bubbles are good for the soul, and a good bubble bath is a great way to relax at the end of a hard day.

When I take a bubble bath I make it an event to remember, because I don’t get the time very often. I often choose lavender scented bubbles, fill the tub up as much as I can, light a few candles, and read a book while I soak. I often put on a CD from my favorite singer, because getting a chance to listen to that is something that doesn’t happen very often either. After about an hour I am totally relaxed, wrinkled, and content.

After a good bubble bath, you should make sure you pamper your body to complete the effect. Use your favorite lotion and put it on every inch of your body to keep your skin soft, and then slip into your warmest bathrobe. This will help the soothing effects of a bubble bath stay with you just a little bit longer. This is also a great time to exfoliate the bottoms of your feet. You can get rid of some of the dead skin and then apply lotion made just for feet. After a few treatments like this, your feet might be as smooth as the rest of your body.

There are safety issues you have to consider when it comes to taking a bubble bath however. Don’t get so relaxed that you fall asleep. This is not really a good idea in a tub full of water. Also remember that it is not a good idea to take a bubble bath very often. For some reason bubble baths disturb the delicate balance of bacteria in your vagina, and this can lead to yeast infections. Space them out so you are only taking one a week or less. Remember to keep this in mind for your daughter as well. Children can have the same problems adults have, and too many bubble baths can mess her up as well.
