For ages, women have been paying special attention to their hair, make up, and nails. This can be a challenging task, especially the nails, for a woman on the go. Between a busy motherhood, duties as a wife, and going through the daily work grind, finger nails are sure to get broken along the way. Luckily, a set of beauty nails can transform even the most unsightly of fingertips into model hands. They are quite easy to use. Simply go through the pressing on process, and voila! It looks as though you spent a lot of money on a fancy manicure – when you know you secret is a set of beauty nails.

Beauty nails, also known as press on, or glue on nails, can be quickly applied with no trouble if you know what you are doing. The  abbreviated capsule process goes like this: First the natural nail is filed to the proper size, and then the surface is buffed. Cuticles are then pushed back, and the beauty nails are applied. It's that simple! You don't need to go through the hassle of daily nail shaping, fear of broken or cracked finger nails, and best of all, your nail polish will stay fresh looking longer. 

First, make sure your nails are well scrubbed and clean. Using a nail brush, clean the surface of your natural nails with soap and water. After this, rub them with an acetone based nail polish remover to get off any particularly stubborn spots.  Your next step is the buffing of the natural nail surface.

It is critical in the application of artificial nails that you make sure the surface of the natural nail is rough. If it isn't, your beauty nails are likely to easily fall off. So, using an emery board,  or nail file, buff the nail bed surface by lightly rubbing the file across the surface. Now you're ready to shape the nails.

Some women have nails that are too large and flat for artificial beauty nails, and so must file them for a good fit. At the edges of the nail, use an emery board to file them down just a bit. With this step out of the way, you can move on to the beauty nail application.  

First, trim the artificial nails to the proper size and shape.  Now, all you need to do is glue them on. Apply a small amount – two to three drops - of nail glue to the base of the nail. Holding the artificial nail by its tip, press the base of the nail into the glue, and continue spreading the glue to the very end of the nail. 

Now you can decorate and paint your beauty nails as you see fit, without the hassles of natural nails. Your hands will look beautifully manicured and stay that way for at least a week!
