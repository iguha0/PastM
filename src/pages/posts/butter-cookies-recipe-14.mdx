With the fast-paced world we live in, things like cooking at home each night and baking are often not part of our schedules. We often turn to take-out and pre-packaged cookies and cakes instead of taking the time to make those things ourselves. Although cooking and baking, in particular, can seem daunting and time consuming there are many things you can make yourself that are easy and taste delicious too. One baked treat that everyone loves are homemade cookies and with a good butter cookies recipe you can bake a few dozen with just a handful of ingredients.

Many of us remember having these delectable treats around the holidays. For some of us we were even lucky enough to help our mothers or grandmothers bake them. If that was the case you may still have her butter cookies recipe tucked away in a drawer or box. If you don’t, don’t fret as there are many wonderful recipes for butter cookies online and in cookbooks.

The standard recipe regardless of the version you create is the same. You’ll need just a few simple ingredients to get started including butter, sugar and flour. Most of us already have these things in our kitchens. Along with those standards a butter cookies recipe also calls for baking powder, salt and vanilla extract. 

Although a plain cookie is always delicious, there are many variations of this particular sweet treat and you are apt to want to try almost every one once you discover how simple they are to make. A popular type of butter cookie that only requires the addition of a fragrant spice and nuts are walnut cinnamon butter cookies. When dipped in a mug of warm tea or coffee, these satisfy every sweet tooth. They also make a wonderful hostess gift when you are invited to a dinner party. Just wrap them up in a nice wicker basket with some pretty tissue and a ribbon. 

Chocolate lovers also have their own version of this standard recipe. Why not experiment with a chocolate butter cookies recipe or perhaps stick with the original recipe and add a decadent chocolate frosting to the cookies? Either way, you are going to get your cocoa fix with these cookies. 

A really good idea is to make a big batch of the type you most like. They freeze so well and if you devote one afternoon every couple of months to baking butter cookies, you’ll have a supply at hand in case company stops by or for your child’s lunch box. The biggest problem you’ll face is how not to eat them all up yourself – they are that delicious!
