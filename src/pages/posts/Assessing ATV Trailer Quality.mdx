Assessing ATV Trailer Quality

If you have or are planning to buy an ATV, chances are that you will need an ATV trailer as well. An ATV trailer allows ATV owners to transport their ATV safely and much more easily than trying to use the bed of a truck. ATV trailers come in a variety of sizes depending on your needs. You can find trailers designed to haul from one to six ATV's at a time. While other flat bed trailers can be used to transport ATV's, a trailer designed for the task is the safest option.

An ATV trailer is made up of a deck that the ATV's are loaded on to and a ramp that folds up during transport and serves as a safety device for holding the ATV in place. Single ATV trailers usually come in two sizes, 5' x 8' and 5' x 10'. The size of your ATV will determine the best size for your ATV trailer. If you have two or more ATV's, you can find trailers that measure 5' x 13 or 5' x 14' that will fit the job. If you need to haul more that two ATV's, you can have ATV trailers custom made to your specifications.

The trailer you choose should be sturdy and strong enough to hold the number of ATVs you intend to haul. Trying to fit more ATV's on a trailer that was not designed for it can cause extreme stress on the trailer and the added weight can cause it to break. Most ATV trailers have a tongue mounting system and you should make sure it is sturdy and will not bend, crack, or twist during transport.

The main support beams on the trailer also need to be strong as this is where the axels attach. The weight of the trailer's load is transferred to these beams during transport and if they are not high quality, they can bend or break. The trailers cross members should also be strong because if they twist or warp it will cause the corners to flex and will crack the trailers welds.

The safest system in an ATV trailer is the tilt clamp system. They are also easy to use and more stable. The tilt clamp system is also faster to attach than a traditional hitch system. The tilt clamp system pulls the trailer and tongue together with a T-bolt that also reduces vibration. No matter what attachment system your ATV trailer uses, make sure it is properly connected and secure. You do not want bumps and vibrations during transport to cause your trailer to become unhitched.

ATV's can be very useful or a fun hobby. Make sure your transport method is the proper one for ATV's and that you use the proper precautions. Always secure your ATV on the trailer and make sure the ramp is secured in the upright position so that it does not fall during transport. An unsecured ATV on the back of a trailer can be extremely dangerous. Only use a high quality trailer to ensure that it will not warp or break and it will last you many years.
