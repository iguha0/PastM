There are certainly some decisions in life that constitute as major. One of these decisions concerns having children. Are you looking to parent a child somewhere in the future? If your answer is no, then you'd better be taking the necessary precautions. The last thing our world needs is more children with parents who never wanted them in the first place. Get the picture? If not, let me make it easy for you. Use protection when having sex! Whether it's with your partner, fiance, or spouse, you should always take the necessary precautions. This may mean condoms, birth control pills, the patch, or a variety of other contemporary birth controls. Which method are you taking advantage of? 

One thing I like to always stress about birth control pills is that they only protect the female from getting pregnant. Of course the protection is not a perfect 100 percent, but it is darn close. Now, the reason I make the comment concerning birth control pills and their sole ability to prevent pregnancy is plain and simply because much of our youth overlooks this. Far too many teens disregard the most important factor. Remember a little something called STDs? This should be your main concern about sex in this day and age. In fact, you can take your pick from infinite STDs out there now days. It seems like there are no limits to the damage they cause. While pregnancy may have been a big worry back in the 50s and 60s, AIDS has pretty much kicked it to the back of the concern line. Get this horrific sickness and you're dead. Therefore I think it's prudent to promote condoms as the number one option for safe sex. Not birth control pills! Condoms not only defend against pregnancy, but they're the second best defense against STDs. Of course abstinence is the first. 

Always get information before taking that gargantuan step with sex. Learn all you can about condoms, birth control pills, the contemporary patch, IUDs and spermacides. This knowledge is imperative if you plan to be intimate with someone. Get on your personal computer and absorb this knowledge in private. The Internet holds an abundance of data on sex, birth control pills and much more.
