ENJOY ALL KINDS OF VACATIONS


You can travel almost anywhere in the world and stay free in
private homes or luxury hotels. How? By one or both of the
following methods:

METHOD 1:

Join a Cooperative Exchange and Travel Club (listed below) for a
small annual membership fee. As a Travel Club Member you will
receive a list of as many as 5,000 names and addresses from all
over the U.S. and throughout the world. Only members receive the
list. As a member, you offer your home as a stopping point for
compatible people when it is convenient for you. In return, you
stay for free in any of the over 5,000 homes throughout the
world!  Most of the people who belong to thee clubs are
interesting, adventurous and fun-loving.

On your next vacation enjoy the personal contact of staying in
someone else's home. See the world on a shoestring and enjoy
yourself. Here are some of the other benefits of a Travel Club
Membership:

      * Develop a pen-pal relationship

      * Find people with similar hobbies
 
      * Exchange home ( instead of staying with members)

      * Drop-in relationships (if you prefer not to stay with     
        members, you might just visit with them to find out what
        is going on in their area, etc..An initial contact when   
        visiting a distant place will make for a more enjoyable   
        vacation).

METHOD 2
      
Become an "Outside Agent" for a travel agency, a tour guide or
co-ordinator for group tours.

Go to a large travel agency and contract with them for a free
trip (All expenses paid!) in exchange for you securing 20 to 30
people to go with you on a group tour.

How to secure others to travel with you? Primarily through your
personal, social and business contacts. Think of a place that
contacts might like to visit. You can get a special discount
group rate for them. They will save on their trip and you will
travel for free.

METHOD 3

Still again,it is possible to appoint yourself as President of
your non-profit organization and have the organization supply you
with a free vehicle will all expenses paid. If  your organization
is a church related corporation, you could tour Europe for free,
to visit cathedrals, as an example. A church can raise money by
"selling" charters, degress and other cheap papers for hundreds
of dollars.
