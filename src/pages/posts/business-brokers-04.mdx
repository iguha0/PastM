There are a lot of reasons that people get excited about moving up the corporate ladder. The most obvious one is more money. Second to that is more power. For me, however, there was a different reason. Don't get me wrong – I love money and power. Who doesn't, after all. Still, the best thing about it for me was getting to understand the process more deeply. I am fascinated by the way that business organization works, and every time I move higher in the chain of command, I get to know something new. In retrospect, I am glad that I started low on the totem pole. Moving from the bottom of the top has taught me things that I never would have learned otherwise.

If you had told me even a year ago that I would be a business broker now, I definitely would never have believed you. After all, I have had very little dealing with business brokers, and had never really thought much about how their jobs work. Buying a business is difficult, and once I had hired a business broker to help me find the perfect deal, but that was about as far as it went. I bought a business, got it running, and never saw him again. He got his cut, and I got to work. It wasn't even mind main gig to be honest, just a little side business to give me some supplemental income when I was starting out.

What I didn't realize back then was the advantages business brokers have. Not only do they make bank, but they also get to see the way the business world works as a whole by buying and selling businesses. I got an inkling of how much I would like being one the first time I sold a business. It was a restaurant that I had been managing as an investment, and I had turned it around pretty quickly. I wanted a little bit of money to invest, so I decide to get rid of it. I made a lot of very quickly – more than I would have made in profits for the next couple years. That is what got me to thinking about business brokers. People involved in brokering businesses buy and sell dozens of businesses in a given year. Doing the math, it didn't make sense not to get involved in it! The money was just too good! If you have the capital and the instincts, join the ranks of business brokers!
