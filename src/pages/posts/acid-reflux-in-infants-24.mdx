Acid Reflux In Infants

New parents worry about a lot of things, and sometimes things pop up that you may never have thought about. If you are one of the lucky ones, you will have a baby that sails through infanthood with nothing more than a cold or two.

The doctors they went to first thought of changing formulas or giving gas medications, but acid reflux in infants was nothing one of their first thoughts.
