American Express

Last evening, I decided to apply for yet another credit card. I’ve never owned an American Express card and figured it was about time that I get one for myself. Everyone seems to have wonderful things to say about them and the commercials always seem convincing. And so, I embarked on my online journey to find an American Express card that would be ideal for me. Little did I know that American Express has a million different types of cards to choose from. Okay, perhaps not a million – but a lot more than I was prepared to review. Some have annual fees; others don’t. Some of them have unlimited spending and others will only extend you a certain amount of credit. Some of them have all kinds of different reward programs that you can choose from as well. You can pick from lots of different designs as well.

I never knew that choosing a credit card could be so difficult. Heck, I never knew that American Express had so many different types of cards to choose from either. I spent almost an hour reading over all of the offers from all of the types of cards that American Express apparently owns. I finally decided on one that has a great balance transfer plan. The standard interest rates seemed a bit high to me but I had accepted an offer for a very low rate for the first year. After that first year, the interest rate would rise. I knew that either I would only use my card for emergencies after that happens or cancel it. These days, people hop back and forth between credit card companies like crazy, trying to get the best deals and bargains. American Express seems to be interested in competing to get more customers as well. I’m not quite sure why you should have to pay an annual fee, but American Express seems to have quite a few cards that will require payment of one. I can understand why if it is for a business and they don’t cap the spending limit. But, I can’t see a point for charging an annual fee for a personal card that has limited spending. Afterall, they’re getting plenty of extra payments from the interest rates. However, I don’t own a credit card company and I cannot speak on their behalf. I simply know that I now own an American Express card and if I can actually believe what I see on television, they are accepted almost everywhere. I’m quite sure that for my first year of having that low interest rate, I will test that out quite a bit.
