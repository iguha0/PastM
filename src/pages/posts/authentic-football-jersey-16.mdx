Many people might be tempted to buy a replica but nothing beats an authentic football jersey. It is much better to invest the extra cash on a quality product used by the pros rather than a replica that you will probably have to replace in relatively little time. You can find a quality authentic football jersey in a number of places.


Whether you are purchasing a present for someone special or whether you are adding to your own football wardrobe you really want the most for your money. Some of us have learned the hard way that a replica jersey can be great but most are sub par. Spending the extra money for the real thing will pay off in the long run. You might find that you have a real collector’s item as well.

I chose to purchase a replica football jersey for my husband a few years ago. The product was definitely not cheap but it really wasn’t the professional grade quality that I had hoped for. I spent a great deal less than I would have if I had bought an authentic football jersey. Actually, the replica jersey cost less than half as much as the real thing.

There is good reason for the vast difference in pricing. The authentic football jersey is much sturdier and thicker than its fake counterpart. The replica also tends to leave much to be desired as far as the print goes as well. I found that the lettering began to peel off after a few washings. This was pretty aggravating and I began to regret the purchase.

My husband loved the replica football jersey and this was evident in the simple fact that he wore it during each and every Sunday game or Monday night football game. This led to the ultimate demise of the shirt. I considered investing in an authentic football jersey instead. 

This was definitely a great decision. My husband was thrilled that I took the time to upgrade to the real thing. He still has the replica but he rarely wears it anymore. The authentic football jersey is far more durable and it is of excellent quality. I just wish that I would have purchased the real thing in the first place. 

When you want the best you definitely have to spend a little extra money. You will find that an authentic football jersey is a better buy than the replica.
