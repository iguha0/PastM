Like most people, I'm becoming more and more concerned about my health now that I'm getting older. I am making a concerted effort to change my lifestyle as much as possible in order to try to prevent serious problems in the future. For example, I follow a sensible low-fat diet, avoid junk food, and have even tried to cut out coffee and carbonated sodas. Of course I needed to find a replacement beverage since coffee and diet Coke were pretty much all I consumed every day. After reading about the benefits of green tea in numerous health studies, the choice was easy.

The benefits of green tea have long been known in Japan, where most of the population partakes of that refreshing beverage. Everyone knows that Japanese people traditionally have some of the highest life expectancy rates on the entire planet, and I personally believe that at least part of that phenomenon has to do with the many health benefits of green tea. For one thing, it is one of the best natural sources of antioxidants that we have at our disposal. These antioxidants attack so-called "free radicals," which are harmful compounds that can cause cell damage. In addition, other benefits of green tea include the prevention of such ailments as heart disease, arthritis, dental cavities, different types of cancer, and could even promote weight loss. 

While medical experts don't unanimously agree upon the many benefits of green tea, I'm personally convinced that this is a good way to protect my health. As I mentioned before, I've decided to incorporate this beverage into my daily diet as a replacement for coffee and sodas. In order to derive as many health benefits of green tea as I can, I've got to maintain a regular supply of the drink in my home. But I live in a rather remote area and can't exactly buy this stuff at the corner grocery store. Instead, if I want to enjoy the benefits of green tea, I'll have to purchase it online. Although that might prove to be a bit inconvenient, my health is definitely worth it.

I've already found a good website that sells pure Japanese green tea and am waiting for my first shipment to come in. I'm excited about the prospect of getting all the benefits of green tea and taking control of my health in such a simple way. If you're concerned about your long-term health, then I recommend that you make the switch too!
