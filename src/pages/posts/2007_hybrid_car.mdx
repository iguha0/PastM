Getting to Know the 2007 Hybrid Car Line Up


More and more car manufacturers are developing "greener" versions of their well-known brands. The infusion of Hybrid technology has made a big splash in the motoring world and its popularity as well as the growing concern for the environment has added to the demand for this type of vehicles, urging more vehicle manufacturers to add more of their vehicles in the hybrid bandwagon to capture more potential consumers in the market.

One of the newest in the batch 2007 hybrid car lineup is the 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid, the third in Toyota's Hybrid vehicles. The Camry hybrid boasts of a performance of a topnotch six-cylinder engine with the fuel economy of a four-cylinder engine. Although it is not as fuel efficient as the first Toyota hybrid, the Prius, the Camry hybrid is a whole lot better than the regular Camry.

Never to be left behind, giant Japanese car manufacture Honda, has also the Hybrid Accord and the Hybrid Civic. These two sedans offer what Hybrids are known for, less emission and less fuel consumption. 

The 2007 Honda Accord Hybrid alone combines luxury and fuel efficiency that is truly environment friendly. Even with a V6 engine that generates 253 horsepower, you can be sure that you will get more miles to the gallon. It is a nice change knowing that you get the luxury and power that you want and still get the fuel economy that we all deserve.

Then there is the 2007 Civic Hybrid which continuously provides the true essence of hybrid technology. Its ingenious engineering has rightly earned it its Advanced Technology Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle (AT-PZEV) rating. What this means is that you don’t only get from point A to point B in less gas usage, but also save the environment by not adding to the air pollutants already swarming over it. 

Joining the Hybrid car race in 2007 is General Motors second Hybrid vehicle, the 2007 Aura Hybrid sedan. This will be competing with other high-end hybrid cars such as the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Honda Accord Hybrid. Sporting a V6 engine as well, the Aura Green Line is dedicated to providing utmost engine power with minimal gas consumption. Its engineers claim that it will be able to generate 20 percent savings in fuel economy over its conventional model.

Nissan has also announced that a 2007 Altima Hybrid will be offered and has offered test drives and a glimpse of its development vehicle. In a deal inked with Toyota, Nissan will be dedicating five years into the project with the Hybrid Technology developed by Toyota.

Rumored to be unveiling its first hybrid model, Volkswagen is said to be preparing a full-hybrid car for 2007 but it hasn’t disclosed yet which car model they will be infusing the technology. Latest rumors said that it would be on the Jetta for the upscale engine level or in the Passat for the four-cylinder class. 

 With more and more vehicle manufacturers realizing the potential of Hybrid vehicles, it wont be long before every car produced will be infused with the Hybrid technology. And as oil prices continue to soar and concerns for the environment are ever growing, we can all be sure that these vehicles will be welcomed with open arms.
