You may fight each night with your mattress, and it might be the reason why you are not getting a good night of sleep. Many times, we don’t realize that this can be a problem for our children as well. To be fair, children are more resilient, and can even sleep on the floor without a lot of complaint and no obvious after effects. However, that does not mean you shouldn’t take the time to find a quality baby mattress that will ensure your child is comfortable.

Size is always important when buying a baby mattress, but you should think about a few other things as well. Some people like to get ones that have a slick cover on them, so that nighttime accidents will not go into the mattress. However, these can be a bit prickly to sleep on, and even the best of these can wear down. That means buying a new baby mattress before you are ready to get them a bigger sized bed. If you don’t want to slick coating on the mattress, you can buy sheets that will offer almost the same protection during the potty training years.

Thickness should be a consideration when buying a baby mattress. You want something that fits your crib or your toddler bed with little give on any side, including how it fits height wise. One of the reasons why children get hurt in cribs and beds is because the mattress was not thick enough, or was not wide enough. This happens when the mattress did not come with the bed, or had to be replaced for some reason. Take these things into account if you have to buy a new baby mattress for your child. Safety should be as important as comfort.

One last consideration when buying a baby mattress is something that you may not consider until after you have bought the mattress. You have to be able to find sheets that fit the bed securely so they do not come off the mattress while the child is sleeping. Children move around a lot, and that calls for a secure fitted sheet. Some sizes of baby mattress are hard to find sheets for, and that can make things difficult for you. You are better off finding a size that you know has sheets readily available where you regularly shop. If not, make sure you can find them online if you do choose an odd shape or size.
