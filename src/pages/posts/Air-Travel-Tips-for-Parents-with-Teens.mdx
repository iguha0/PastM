Air Travel Tips for Parents with Teens

Are you the parent of a teenager?  If you are, are you in the process of planning a trip that requires air travel?  If so, you may be looking for tips that can help you and you family have a nice and pleasant flight.

When traveling with a teenager, you will find that you are very lucky.  This is due in part to your child’s age.  Teenagers are likely to be more pleasant and cooperative on flights, especially when compared to toddlers and preschoolers.  Still, you may be looking for some extra tips, just in case.

One of the first things that you will want to do is teach your child the importance of watching what is said at the airport.  With security concerns, it is not uncommon for travelers to be detained for a closer look, even just when joking.  Many teens do like to joke around, so be sure to let your teen know the danger of doing so.  Make sure that they know not to repeat certain words in an airport, such as knife, gun, bomb, or terrorist.  Your teenager may already know this important piece of information, bt there is no harm in providing a quick reminder.

If you let your child pack their own bags for your trip, be sure to give them a quick look over.  The checking of your teen’s carry-on luggage is extremely important.  Does your child have anything in their carry-on bag that may result your family being stopped at an airport security checkpoint?  As for checked baggage, make sure that your child’s bags are not overfilled.  Also, make sure that they don’t put anything of great value or importance, like a digital camera or a laptop computer, in a checked bag, as damage can occur.

You will also want to make sure that your child has a drink or snack for the trip. This is particularly ideal for short flights or picky eaters and drinkers. Although many dry snacks, like chips, are okay to pickup before arriving at the airport, drinks are another story.  Due to a limit on liquids, have your child get a soda, water, or juice at an airport store, namely one that is positioned after you have passed through all needed security checkpoints.  This approach may cost more money, but the end result is much less hassle.

Since all passengers are allowed a carry-on bag, you will want to make sure that your child brings things that interest them.  For example, books and magazines are cheap ways to keep teens occupied on an airplane ride.  Extra items that are perfect for teens include handheld video gaming consoles, DVD players, and MP3 players.  There are some locations in the United States where you can rent these items if you or your teen doesn’t already own them.  When using anything electronic, be sure to bring a few extra batteries and keep them in your purse or in a carry-on bag.

As highlighted above, there are a number of steps that you, as a parent, can take to ensure that your next family flight is pleasant for you and your teenager.  Although teenagers are more likely to be pleasant and cooperative, the above mentioned points can still provide you with much needed assistance, as well as comfort and peace of mind.
