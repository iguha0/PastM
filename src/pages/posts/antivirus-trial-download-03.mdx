Do you ever run into trouble with your personal computer? Chances are you do. There's practically no way to avoid some kind of trouble somewhere down the road. Stuff just happens. It's basically a rule of life. Anyway, speaking as someone who has owned computers for the past 8 years, I think I've had some valid experiences. Just to be clear, my experiences have concerned five different computers. Three of which were laptops. If there is one thing I've learned, it's that computers get afflicted with viruses and spyware. Those nasty little bugs always slip in somehow. Some are terrible and some are mere annoyances that slow down your system. Have you experienced any of this with your personal computer yet? If you have, it may be high time for an antivirus trial download. Test it before you buy it. 

The cool thing about an antivirus trial download is that you get to sample the software before you literally pay for it. See if it's actually worth your time and money. Lord knows there are oodles of anti-virus and anti-spyware programs out there to choose from. Now I'm about to say something that a lot of people do not want to hear. Viruses are for PCs. I have owned four PCs and one Mac, and the Mac is never afflicted by viruses. This may be because most are created for PCs. I simply don't know. But I can tell you that it's refreshing to say the least when I'm on my Mac. I never have to deal with spyware, viruses or pop-ups. This means no antivirus trial download either. Not for the Mac. That stuff is strictly for my PCs. Sometimes I get annoyed with my IBM because it has a pop-up blocker on the browser, but for some reason I still get a few pop-ups. My wife experiences the same with her Dell. I must come to the conclusion that it's a PC thing. What is your take on the PC versus Mac issue? Now remember you can't really comment unless you've used both on a regular basis. 

Looking for a decent antivirus trial download? Hey, you shouldn't have to look far. These are all over the World-Wide-Web these days. Just get on Google.com and punch in the words "antivirus trial download." You should have plenty of options at your fingertips. Scan your system for bugs, viruses and spyware today. You never know; there could be tons of it there.
