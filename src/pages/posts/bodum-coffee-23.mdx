Everyone who appreciates a good cup of coffee knows the value of having the right equipment to make it. The Bodum Coffee Company was founded in 1944 in Denmark and is still a family concern. The first of their own products, the Santos Coffee maker, came on the market in 1958 and is still available today. The company produces kitchenware and tableware but is mostly known for its French coffee presses.

These products are both functional and stylish and will look good in any kitchen or café. Everything is designed with flavor in mind. The Bistro Nouveau coffee or tea glass is made from heat resistance glass and has a black, plastic handle. The glass keeps coffee and tea warm and can also be used for soup. The glasses are suitable for cleaning in the dishwasher.

The Eileen is a black and stainless steel frame Bodum coffee maker in the French press style. It has a square handle for easy grip and it is chosen by bistro and café owners. The Costa Rica 8 Cup French Press also has a stainless steel frame and an easy grip curved handle with a rubber coating. Coffee is quick and easy to make. Ground coffee is put into the flask, hot water is added and stirred with a wooden or plastic spoon. After three or four minutes, the plunger is pressed and perfect coffee is the result.

The Travel Press is transparent and holds 16oz of liquid. It serves as a Bodum coffee maker and tea maker, mixing hot water with ground coffee or tea leaves. Other products from the company include electric coffee grinders, milk frothers, electric water kettles and espresso machines. Accessories are also available for the Bodum coffee maker line. The 4 minute timer can be fitted to all the machines and is powered by a battery. The range of accessories also includes chrome measuring spoons and drip filters.

Storage is important in keeping coffee fresh and dry. Bodum supplies a storage jar with a sealed lid and a removable silicon gasket. The jar is dishwasher friendly and can also be used to store tea, herbs, sugar or rice. All of the machines are designed to be durable. However, should anything need replacing, there are spare parts available for all the Bodum coffee makers and other equipment. It's reassuring to the consumer that the professionals also buy the products and put their trust in the company.
