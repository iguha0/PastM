Beauty Rest

There is nothing more wonderful for your looks than beauty rest. I always remember my mom and my aunts saying they need their beauty rest, but I never understood what sleep had to do with looking good. Now I know that sleep is one of the most important things you can do for your body inside and out. Proper sleep is essential to peace of mind and a healthy body. The healthier you are on the inside, the more radiant you will be on the outside. It is as simple as that!

If you want to get your beauty rest, you have to make sure you are getting enough of it. I have been having problems sleeping myself, and you can see it in my face. I’m not sure what the problem is but you can definitely tell I have not been getting enough beauty rest. I look tired and worn out, and it seems that even makeup isn’t helping much. If you are having troubles sleeping, it is going to show. You can always tell the difference between someone getting peaceful beauty rest and someone who tosses and turns all night long. Make sure you are getting seven or eight hours a night.

You also need a good mattress for proper beauty rest. If you have an old, lumpy mattress, you aren’t going to sleep well. I am beginning to think this is my problem, and I am going to have to spring for a new mattress before too much more time passes. If your mattress is way too soft, or perhaps too firm, you are not going to sleep well. You may also have a problem if your bed is too small. If you are sleeping in a full size with your husband, you both may be having trouble getting enough beauty rest. You need enough space to spread out in order to get good, restful sleep.

If you have a good bed, but can’t figure out why you aren’t getting enough beauty rest, you should consider your environment. Your bedroom should be for sleeping. If you are looking at clutter, or piles of work you have to do the next day, you aren’t going to sleep well. Keep work out of your bedroom, and keep the clutter picked up. Also, consider if light or sound are interfering with your beauty rest. Wear a sleeping mask and get a fan or white noise machine to eliminate noises that might be keeping you awake at night.
