Adware and spyware, knowing the basics

People think that there is actually no difference between a spyware and an adware. Spyware is just a web term used to refer to an advertising supported software, which is otherwise known as adware. These are the pop-up ads that often come out whenever we open a website or download a shareware software. But according to some web experts, spyware is much much more. 

Supporters of spyware and adware say that though it can be pretty annoying at times especially if you are really in a hurry, both do give consumers huge benefits. Because the product ads generate income for developers of shareware software, consumers can get them for free. Developers are in turn paid for their work. Of course, if you donâ€™t want to be bothered by the constant pop-ups, you can always pay the licensing fee or the regular fee for the software. If you want it for free, you just have to sacrifice through the spyware. 

There is however another downside to it. Spyware, from the name given to it, is actually used as a tracking device in your computer system. These tracking devices will look into your surfing habits, your chatting logs and even the number of times you open your email. If designed or programmed the right way, it can discover just about everything else in your system. 
And because the program runs in the background, there is no way that a person can control the kind of information that he or she sends out. 

These kinds of programs were actually originally used by parents or people in the business sector who wish to track down and put on record web activity. It is actually beneficial but not when people are not aware that they are being tracked down. This is often the case when people download software over the Internet. As mentioned before, it is used by companies to advertise their products and in turn help the developers of software keep their costs down so that they can afford to offer their programs for free.

Although privacy issues indeed come into play, there is nothing illegal about it. In fact, its use is prevalent all over the World Wide Web. There are however some areas that people who value their privacy will object to. Because of this, people are given the option to refuse the software.    

There is really no way that one can avoid adware and spyware as these programs are packaged with the software that you will be downloading from the Internet. The most that you can do is to avoid downloading from the internet and to refuse any file downloads that you did not personally authorize. It is also good to only view websites that have a good reputation or those that have anti-spyware and adware programs installed in their pages.
