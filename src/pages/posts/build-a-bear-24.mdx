Build A Bear

I didn’t know much about build a bear until I ran into a woman from Australia who was visiting the US. She had taken her children there, and they have fallen in love with the idea. I was familiar with the company, but because there was not one in my area, I had never been there. She had an interest in bears already, and she was immediately smitten with the idea of the store. She wanted to know where she could get more outfits once she returned to Australia.

From what I gather, you go to Build A Bear and you do just that. You build a bear. You can also choose a variety of different stuff animals now, and you can costumes and accessories in almost any theme that you can imagine. Her daughter had a poodle, I believe, and it might have been one of the cutest things I had seen in a long time. The mom was excited about perhaps getting a load of different costumes for the animals, and her daughter seem to already be attached to her new stuffed dog.

Build A Bear is a great idea, but I have also come to realize it can be quite expensive to go in and choose an animal and all of the outfits you may want. It is far more expensive that just buying a stuffed bear from any store shelf, but I guess that is part of the idea behind Build A Bear. If you pay good money for your bear or other animal, you want to know it will last a long time and is of good quality. I would guess they have that part covered or they wouldn’t still be in business.

It is a good business, and if you are looking for idea for a business, you might want to consider Build A Bear if there isn’t one in your area. I’m not sure if you can get a franchise store or not, but I would think they work just like any other franchise. You can contact the Build A Bear company for more information if you are interested. In some cases, these stores are operated by the owner only, and they choose where they will open and who will run the store. You will have to call them and find out if you are interested. It might be a fun and interesting place to go to work everyday, don’t you think?
