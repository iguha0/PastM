Camping is one of the most enjoyable activities for families. There’s nothing quite like getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city to live in a tent for a few days. The outdoors has so many appealing qualities including fresh air, the landscape and the peace and quiet. There are some negatives and those include the insects and bears. It’s important to be prepared for an encounter with a bear and a good way to do this is to carry bear spray.

Most of us will go through our entire lives without coming face to face with a bear. In fact, the closest many of us get to this wild animal is seeing one at a zoo. They do live in many popular camping areas though and using bear spray when you meet up with one is the safest way to protect yourself.

Some people claim that carrying a gun is the only real protection against bears. There are a few concerns with this form of defense. The most notable is the fact that carrying a firearm can result in serious harm to both you and the bear. 

When you run into a bear you will most likely panic. This is completely understandable and if you do happen to be carrying a loaded gun, anything can happen. On the other hand, if you have a can of bear spray in your pocket, and are prepared to use it, you can give yourself enough time to get away while the bear is distracted.

It’s fairly easy to use and it’s been suggested that you try it before venturing out into the wild. Naturally you don’t want to point it towards you, so be certain that you hold the bear spray at arm’s length pointing away from you. Try to spray it so you get a feeling for how it works. If you ever do happen to need it, you’ll be more inclined to use it properly if you’ve already experimented.

This product is dangerous to human beings so it’s vital that you keep it out of the reach of children. If you have bear spray with you, ensure that your children understand that it’s something they are not to touch. If you store it at home, do so in a cabinet that is high enough that young children cannot reach it. 

We all hope that we’ll never have to deal with a bear in the wilderness, but if it does happen, it’s good to be prepared. It can be the difference between living to tell the heroic story of the encounter or becoming part of a tragic story.
