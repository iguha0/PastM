You have plenty of choices when it comes to bridal shoes so make sure that you have a good idea of what style you want in general. The first consideration that you want to make is the season that the wedding will be held. A summer ceremony will call for different bridal shoes than ones that would suit a winter wedding.

For example, a summer wedding ceremony would call for strapped sandals, open-toed shoes, sling backs or peep-toes. Each of these designs is wonderful for warm summer days and they look fantastic.

Weddings that occur during late fall; winter and early spring will require different women’s formal footwear. Closed-toe shoes are better for colder months.
