Defending Oneself Using Nothing But Aikido Tomiki

Imagine walking home late at night when suddenly a group of people come out of nowhere and begin to surround you. The individual can cry out for help in the hopes that the locals will offer assistance or just give the money and hope that the hoodlums will leave after that. 

But what if these people want more just than the money in the bag? The use of pepper spray or mace can probably knock two of the individuals out but something better is needed for proper defense. A good example is learning a martial art and if the person does not want to inflict that much damage, then aikido is the way to go.

What is aikido? This is a Japanese martial art just like Judo or Karate that uses primarily the arms to block offensive moves and then redirect it back with the same force to the opponent. 

It is like catching a ball with one hand and then returning it back to another player. The moves are very fast which will surely amaze anyone who has seen one of Steven Segal’s action movies. 

Aikido unlike other martial arts has been around since the 1930’s. As more students learned from the man who invented it, a number of dojo’s both in Japan and in other parts of the world were formed. This has also led to the development of different techniques in Aikido such as Aikikai, Yoshinkan and Yoseikan. 

Practicing with a sparring partner and doing drills in the dojo is nothing compared to actual combat. This is the reason that the best way to stay in shape is to participate in a competition better known as Tomiki Aikido.      

Aikido unlike other martial arts has not yet taken center stage in the Olympics. However, there are regular competitions organized by university clubs and local dojos in the community. 

The competition just like in Karate, Tae Kwan Do or Judo is between two people. The player who successfully strikes the other opponent gets earns a point.

Aikido is a martial art that can be learned by almost anyone regardless of gender or age. All the person has to do is signup in a dojo, learn the basics and then practice regularly to develop better skills.

The individual may not get it right the first time or fall more often than others but everyone had to undergo the same thing in order to become a better fighter. 

When the person is ready, it wouldn’t hurt to participate in Tomiki Aikido, which is held monthly in different states. The person should just see if there is anything on the bulletin board or online since certain clubs also announce such events on the web. 

Aikido is primarily for defensive purposes. There are no sharp offensive punches or kicks normally associated with other martial arts. It can prepare anyone both physically and mentally to respond to various situations.  

Self defense is something everyone needs to learn. Having a small knife or pepper spray can help bit if the odds are too many, then it is time to use hand to hand combat. An attack may not happen tomorrow or one week from now but the skills learned in Aikido will come in handy to be able to defend oneself against criminal elements and stop becoming a victim.
