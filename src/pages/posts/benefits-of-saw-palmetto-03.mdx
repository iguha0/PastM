I first heard of saw palmetto when I was in college. It was mentioned by a girl in my biology class. The professor instantly knew what it was. However, I on the other hand was confused. As opposed to raising my hand in class and letting everyone know that I had no idea what it was, I decided on an alternative route to information. The Internet! It took me only a few minutes to learn the basic benefits of saw palmetto. So, who wants to hear them? Well, first of all, saw palmetto is great for men because it aids in the prevention of prostate problems. The benefits of saw palmetto also include stress management, hair loss prevention; help with chest congestion, and thyroid deficiencies. Believe it or not, saw palmetto even helps you urinate better. These are incredible benefits. Probably one of the most widely noticed ones is the hair loss prevention. It always goes straight to the vanity first. No one wants to lose their precious dew. Well, here's the spiel. Saw palmetto blocks DHT. This is the terrible catalyst that causes male and female pattern baldness. When it interacts with your hair follicles, the hair is weakened and falls out. Then unfortunately it doesn't come back. Over the years these missing hairs can really add up. Suddenly you're bald on top with a ten inch forehead. 

You can find all sorts of products now days that offer the benefits of saw palmetto. As far as that hair issue goes, check into the shampoos and conditioners that offer DHT blockers. There are plenty of these to go around. Furthermore, look into supplements that offer the benefits of saw palmetto in reference to your health. This is a great way to help prevent cancer.
