ATV Transporting Tips

Transporting an ATV can be a challenge, especially if you do not have the right equipment. Trying to transport an ATV in the back of a truck or in an all purpose trailer is not the best idea. It can be dangerous and make the task more difficult than it has to be. An unsecured ATV is dangerous and can injure people, and damage your truck or the ATV. If you are going to transport your ATV, make sure you use a specially designed ATV trailer and properly secure your ATV. Taking large heavy equipment such as an ATV on trips with you can be stressful, but using the proper trailer will reduce the amount of stress and make your tripe and enjoyable one.

An ATV trailer is a type of trailer made to transport ATV's. Loading, unloading, and moving your ATV is much easier with a specially designed trailer and your ATV will be much more secure during transport. Most ATV trailers are made low to the ground and include a ramp that also folds up to secure your ATV after loading it. ATV trailers are made to withstand the weight of an ATV and have other safety features including places to use straps to secure your ATV. 

There are some tips you should remember to make the most of your trip while transporting an ATV. Loading and unloading your ATV may seem like the hardest part, but compared to the challenges of driving with a trailer in tow these steps are relatively easy. Make sure the ramp on your trailer stays in good condition and if it is not attached, make sure it will not slip while you load or unload your ATV.

Driving while hauling your ATV in a trailer will prove to be the hardest part of transporting your ATV. Every move you make with your vehicle will cause your trailer to move as well. If you switch lanes or turn often, your trailer will also sway and move form side to side. Because the trailer is being towed a short distance behind your vehicle, the reaction of the trailer will be delayed.

It will take a few seconds longer for the trailer to stop swaying and the movements of the trailer may be more exaggerated than that of your vehicle. If you are new to towing trailers, you should practice on quiet roads near your house before you attempt to tow your ATV long distances.

Acceleration and braking is also different when you are towing a trailer. Obviously, you will not be able to accelerate as fast when towing a trailer so make sure you give yourself plenty of room when entering the road. You will also not be able to brake as quickly so do not follow as close to cars as you normally would.

The faster you drive, the more your trailer will move so always drive with caution while pulling your ATV trailer. You should also make sure your ATV is properly secured on the trailer so that is does not come loose from bumps and vibrations and get damaged or cause damage to anything else.
