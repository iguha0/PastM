An adware is usually considered as a legitimate alternative offered by software companies to consumers who do not wish to pay for a software product. An adware can be distributed as a program, game or software utility designed and distributed as freeware. 

There are cases where adware programs that are considered as freeware have features and functions that are blocked until you pay in order to register it. As freeware, most or all features are enabled for use but may have sponsored advertisements that come along with them while the freeware is being used. These sponsored advertisements usually run in a small section of the software interface or it can be displayed as a pop-up ad box on your PC. When you stop running the software, the ads should disappear.

There are times that these ads frequently pop-up on your desktop when you least expect them to.

The functions of a certain spyware program can be malicious and may secretly work its havoc without you ever noticing it. They can be installed by posing as a freeware that is offering a computer user something useful. Once the freeware has been downloaded, the spyware may then find its way into your computer and do its dirty deed. 

Spyware programs usually try to monitor your online activity and transmit that information to the spyware propagator.

Some more malicious spyware programs even go to the extent of monitoring your keystrokes which makes it possible for some spyware propagators to record and find out about sensitive computer information such as passwords, credit card numbers and email addresses.
