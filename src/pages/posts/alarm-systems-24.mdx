alarm systems

When most people think of alarm systems, they think of the systems that alert the police when someone is breaking in, or will call through to the fire station if the house is on fire. These are pretty standard things for those who have them, but what I did not know, and what many do not know, is that there is so much more that these systems can do today, though much of it is used in commercial buildings. Some homeowners may find they would like things such as these as well, especially if they travel away from home for long periods of time.

My husband works for a large construction company, and when something goes wrong with one of their buildings in our town, he is the one they call. It doesn’t happen all of the time, but it does seem that the alarm systems have hair triggers, and there are times when we get a lot of calls, many of them in the middle of the night. They aren’t all about motion detectors, fires, or even burglar alarms. The calls often have to do with things that may go wrong with the building and cause damage.

I had no idea, but there are alarm systems that could gauge the heat of a building, but they do it. One building in particular has a very touchy heating and cooling system. When the temps drop down to far, the alarm systems go off as a warning. This then usually leads to a call to our home in the middle of the night. When the temps get too low, the system can freeze, and the entire building will be messed up by the next day. These alarms don’t come in the summer, but they come often in the winter. My husband has to get out of bed to go fix the problem.

Even more amazing, alarm systems can detect water. After a particularly bad rain last week, something busted in a basement, and water filled the rooms up to about twelve inches. The basement had offices for a lawyer, a tax office, and a physical rehabilitation office. The first notice they had that something was wrong was an alarm that warned of high water. Thanks to the alarms, the problem was taken care of immediately. There was still damage, but there would have been more if no one had known until Monday morning.
