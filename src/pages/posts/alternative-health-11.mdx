Alternative Health and You

Alternative medicine has long been used to treat a variety of conditions from psoriasis to dysentery. Today the amount of holistic therapies is staggering, and not all of it created equal, which is why it’s so important to keep up to date on the latest happenings in this rapidly growing field. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is a part of the US National Institutes of Health, located online at www.nccam.nih.gov, which is undertaking research, training, and dissemination of data to the public and professionals regarding the most popular health topics. This is a comprehensive site that discusses at length what consumers should know about the latest in alternative health claims, and other consumer concerns and issues. Check out current clinical trials, research funding opportunities, and the continuing education series for all alternative health professionals.

From Natural Solutions at www.alternativemedicine.com find complementary and alternative health medicine information about common health conditions, including natural remedies,  holistic healthcare, healing foods, as well as healthy solutions and practical strategies for self-care and prevention. A popular topic for this time of year is seasonal affective disorder or SAD, which results from shorter winter days and less sunlight. Decreased energy levels are a common complaint that can be reversed simply by tanning or light therapy for twenty minutes every morning, eating more protein and omega-3, and by squeezing in any type of outdoor exercise whenever possible to boost serotonin levels from the natural sunlight. In extreme cases it may even be worth relocating to a sunnier locale to avoid the winter blues altogether.  

Find true health, and empower yourself to make informed nutritional decisions, holistically. Health resources with remedies A-Z for your alternative health needs can be found online for information on alternative, ayruvedic, aromatherapy, homeopathic, essential oils, flower remedies, herbs, and more alternative treatments and therapies. Also discover sites devoted to medical systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine, including sections for spiritual self-healing. It’s important to be knowledgeable about combining alternative medicine, supplements, vitamins, herbs, and nutrition with conventional medicine too, so be sure to advise your health care professional of everything. If you’re not sure where to start, health counseling is available online for your convenience for help to feel better in your body and achieve your ideal weight. This is also a great way to manage and reduce your stress, increase your energy levels, find healthier ways to eat, and take on a truly holistic approach to life.
