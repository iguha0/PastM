The United States has produced many television evangelists and Benny Hinn is one of the more well known ones. He has a loyal core of followers and has attracted controversy and detractors too. His charismatic stage presence and merchandising skill has given him a high profile. Comic actor Steve Martin is said to have been inspired by Hinn's stage presentations, when he played the role of an evangelist in the movie, Leap of Faith. Martin plays a character in need of redemption.

The Christian crusader was born in Israel and was brought up in the Greek Orthodox faith. Benny Hinn received a secondary education in Toronto.
