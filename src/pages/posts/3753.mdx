150 FIRMS THAT PAY YOU TO WORK AT HOME

Dear Opportunity Seeker,

Enclosed is the listings that you requested. According to all the
available information and sources within our computer network,
the companies listed here have shown a great need for home-based
workers such as yourself. All of our listed companies are revised
on a regular basis, since some of them may change their needs or
requirements. Although we believe our information to be
completely reliable. We cannot however, guarantee its complete
accuracy and we never stop researching firms in the HOMEWORK
INDUSTRY and make every effort to provide the type of programs
that you, the homebased worker are seeking.

It is now the time for you to read over the listed companies and
pick those in the various groups that you wish to contact. We
urge that you PLEASE contact each and every company listed,
regardless of which group they are in. All that's now required is
to send a large business (10) envelope with one (1) 29 cent stamp
affixed in the upper right hand corner. You then address this
envelope to yourself (SASE) leaving it unsealed, then fold it
into another #10 envelope that you will address to each of the
companies below. BEFORE sealing the mailing envelope, neatly
print or type a short note asking details on their HOMEWORKERS
PROGRAM (S). It is requested you DO NOT write long letters since
they are not read and are often discarded by mail room personnel,
and even if that is not the case, you do not want the companies
response to be delayed, simply because your inquiry laid around
while someone tried to determine just what you were requesting.

Once the listed companies receive your inquiry, they have
instructions to send your materials. Please follow directions. If
you send anything other than what is called for, you will get
little or no response. Be patient, some firms are very large,
international in size, some are on a seasonal basis, so it might
take a few weeks for some responses to reach you.

NOTICE

The listed companies have been separated into 3 different groups,
based upon the type of work they offer. If you are NOT going to
contact all companies listed, be sure to check which particular
group is of interest to you, before you write to any companies.

The following companies usually have more than one to offer. If
so, they will present you with all their opportunities after you
contact them. Which offers they send you and in what order they
will be sent, depends entirely entirely upon their processing
abilities at that time.
