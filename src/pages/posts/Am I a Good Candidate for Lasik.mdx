Am I a Good Candidate for Lasik?

So many people are interested in the Lasik vision correction procedure, and want to know the benefits, the risks, and how the Lasik procedure works.  One of the first things to consider is what requirements a person should meet in order to have a successful Lasik procedure.  Though each individual case should be discussed with a qualified Lasik physician, here are some guidelines to see if you are a good candidate for Lasik vision correction.

First, the eye should be properly matured.  This means that anyone under the age of 18 really needs to wait before a Lasik procedure is done, for it is likely that the shape of their eye will continue to change for several years.  If the eye shape changes after the Lasik operation is done, the clarity of vision will be affected.  Some Lasik physicians recommend waiting until age 25 in some cases.

In addition to an age cutoff, the vision prescription for the Lasik candidate should be stable for at least one year, and preferably for longer than that.  This is for the same reason as above, that the Lasik procedure will only continue to be effective if the eye shape remains constant after surgery.

One comment about age cutoffs should be made with regard to Lasik surgery.  There is no maximum age, as many patients in their fifties to their eighties have had a very successful Lasik procedure.  The main consideration in these cases is enough tear production for successful healing and lubrication after the Lasik vision correction.

The eyes of the Lasik candidate should be healthy.  This means that any person undergoing a Lasik procedure should have had no eye infection or injury for at least a year, and must have no scarring on the cornea of the eye.  In addition, they must not have any recurring eye problem, such as a history of herpes infection in the eyes.

The medical history of a prospective Lasik client also plays an important part.  Some chronic conditions, such as autoimmune disorders like Lupus, will prevent some people from being able to schedule a Lasik procedure.  You should be very clear about any and all medical conditions that are current, or even completed ones in the past.  Also, women who are pregnant or nursing should wait to have a Lasik procedure scheduled.

A good Lasik physician will also not schedule people with dry eye syndrome for Lasik vision correction.  Having sufficient tear production is important, though for minor problems this may be aided by medication during the healing process.  In addition, those people with eyes that dilate very widely are not good candidates for Lasik.  

These are most of the most common reasons that a person should look at some other eye improvement choice other than Lasik.  Most generally healthy people with standard vision problems benefit greatly from a Lasik procedure done by a trained, professional Lasik physician.  Look for a good Lasik center in your area and discuss your individual case in detail.
