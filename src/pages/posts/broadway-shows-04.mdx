I just simply love going to a Broadway musical. It is just simply one of my favorite things in the whole world to do, without a doubt. Although I live in the middle of New Jersey, I will often take trips to New York City just to watch Broadway shows on the weekend. In fact, if I did not watch so many Broadway musicals, I would probably have some money to spare. I know that there is always a local theater scene to enjoy, but really, who wants to enjoy that. I love Broadway shows because of the glitz and glamor, the lights and the songs. Local theater just has the same boring old stories, always hung up on things like plot and character development. Honestly, I can not even pay attention to a whole show unless it is one of the Broadway shows. Without all of the songs and such to break it up, who really can care? Not me for one, and that is for sure.

Of course, there are some people who say that musical theater is just a cheap and boring gimmick. They say that Broadway shows, and all musicals for that matter, are made by people who do not have the talent to actually write a script on their own. Instead, they make up for lousy writing by inserting song and dance numbers every few minutes to keep people entertained. But come on, of course theater needs song and dance. I mean, it should at least try to keep up with the times. Give me a break. A broadway show without songs is not done in Broadway, it's done in hollywood, and it is not called a musical, its called a movie. If people don't want their plays to be seen as quaint and antiquated, they should either adapt them for the big screen, or turn them in to Broadway shows. 

If you have never been to Broadway shows before, it is important to find something really accessible to go to for your very first time. I recommend something like Les Miserables, or Phantom of the Opera. Above all, Phantom is accessible. With a simple and compelling story line, and a strong theme, played on organ, that will have you riveted to your seat, Phantom of the Opera is one of the best Broadway shows of all time, and that is a fact. You have got to check it out.
