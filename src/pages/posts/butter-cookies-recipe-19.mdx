There are many traditions that I have in my family and with friendships. My husband and I have enjoyed carrying on some of the traditions that we practiced in the families that we grew up in and we have also established new traditions that we have done within our family. As with most traditions and celebrations many of our rituals involve food.

We are both of German heritage and we both enjoy cooking as well as eating. From the time our children were little we have included them in preparing meals on a day to day basis and we have made special occasions out of preparing foods for our traditional celebrations. One of my fondest memories of helping my mom in the kitchen was making my grandmother’s butter cookies recipe. It was fun making the different shapes out of the rolled out dough and then decorating the cookies once they were baked. Mom would have a variety of sprinkles and different colored frostings for us to use on the sugar cookies. 

I have used my grandmother’s butter cookies recipe with my children. They enjoy making these cookies so much that we have increased the occasions that we make them for. My mother would only make the butter cookies recipe once a year at Christmas time. We also make the cut out cookies for Valentines Day, Easter and the fourth of July. The key to any good butter cookies recipe is that the dough has plenty of butter and that you leave it in the refrigerator for several hours and preferably over night. Having cold dough allows for easier rolling without needing to add extra flour, which can produce a dry cookie with little taste. Depending upon the holiday I will use different spices to add to the butter cookies recipe. At Christmas I add cinnamon to the dough and for Easter I add lemon extract. The key is to not worry about the mess and let the kids be as creative as they want to be with decorating. I have found that if I cover their work space with a cheap plastic table cloth the clean up is easy because I simply throw away the plastic when we are done. I also set aside cookies that I want frosted special for serving for parities or to take to various functions.

Now that our children are grown we have started making these special cookies with our grandchildren. It is neat that my grandmother’s butter cookies recipe is now bringing smiles to yet another generation.
