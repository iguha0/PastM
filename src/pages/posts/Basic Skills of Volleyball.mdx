Basic Skills of Volleyball

The worst situation that a volleyball team could be in is to show up at a game without knowing what skills they needed to win the game.  Hitting the ball, being in the right place, and playing competitively can help to win the game as well as gain confidence in the sport.  Focusing on the basics for volleyball can help you to gain the skills you need for every game.  

1.  Serving.  This is what always starts the game and helps to keep the game.  There are two basic types of serves.  One is overhand; where the player will throw the ball in the air first, then hit it.  The second is underhand, where the server will hold the ball and swing their other arm underneath the ball to hit it.  There are a variety of other serves beyond these basics, all which help to get the ball over the net, and get the game going.  

2.  Pass or reception.  This is usually set up by the setter of the game.  It is used in order to take the ball and give it to the other players on your own team.  They will then have the ability to put the ball to the other side like they want to.  You can either pass by the forearm or by hitting the ball overhead.  

3.  Tip.  A tip is used as a way to trick the other team into thinking that the ball is going further than it will.  The player will hit the ball lightly, making it go over the net but not too far into the other player's area so that they can't hit it back.  

4.  Dig.  This is the ability for a player to save the ball from hitting the court after it has been spiked.  It usually requires a player to slide underneath the ball on the court or to dive underneath the ball.  

5.  Rebound.  This occurs when the ball stays on one side, making the players rebound, or take the ball back.  

With all of these different hits for a ball, you will want to make sure that the players have the ability to move freely and effectively with every move.  With all of these different hits, the players will need to connect where they want to hit the ball with the way that their feet move.  For example, a dig will require the feet to move under the body in order to save the ball.  A serve will require more balance on both feet in order to hit the ball more effectively.  This will be important to keep in mind as you are training players.  

The basics of volleyball hits can lead a long way when you are working towards playing the game.  If you are finding ways to teach techniques to players, this is the place to start.  It will allow everyone to have a good chance at controlling and hitting the ball, no matter what the set up is.
