When I was younger, I used to have fantastic abs. I watched what I ate, limited my fat intake, and did hundreds of crunches per day. Yes, it was very hard work, but the results were worth it. Then everything changed after I gave birth to my first child. I was suddenly very soft around the middle, had noticeable love handles, and couldn't get rid of the flab no matter how many different diets I tried. To make matters worse, I couldn't even do crunches anymore because I had severe chronic back pain. I wasn't ready to accept being out of shape, so I decided to check out some abdominal exercise machines.

Abdominal exercise machines are specially designed to target the abs during each workout. Most abdominal exercise machines simulate regular crunches, but in a way that is much easier on the body. For example, most people do crunches while lying on the floor with their hands behind their head, which puts them at risk for back and neck injuries if they don't have perfect form. That's not a problem with abdominal exercise machines since they limit your motions and force you to have good form in order to operate the mechanisms. In other words, abdominal exercise machines are practically foolproof and give the rest of your body a break while you work on your abs.

I had seen plenty of late-night infomercials for abdominal exercise machines, but wasn't willing to make a purchase decision based solely on what I heard on TV. I wanted to hear what real people had to say about these abdominal exercise machines, not what actors and professional bodybuilders were paid to say. So I went online to find third-party consumer reviews of some of the leading abdominal exercise machines. I wanted to know which products were well-constructed, easy to use, and actually worked on sculpting abs, and which products would just waste my time. Plus, I wanted to find websites where I could buy the most popular abdominal exercise machines at the lowest prices. These products were very expensive, so any discounts I could get would definitely help my wallet.

It's a good thing I decided to read online reviews of abdominal exercise machines before buying one. It turns out that the one product I really had my eye on wasn't received very well by consumers. There were a couple of big problems with it that I never would have known about until it was too late if I hadn't done the proper research first. So I actually ended up buying one of the other abdominal exercise machines that was lower down on my list but that received rave reviews.

Now that I've got one of these abdominal exercise machines, I'm able to work on my abs several times a week without experiencing any back pain at all. And more importantly, I'm slowly but surely starting to see a reduction in my waist size. If I keep this up, I know I'll be back to my pre-childbirth body in a few months!
