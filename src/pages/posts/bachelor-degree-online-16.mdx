Furthering your education is always a good investment. However, going to college may not be the most convenient approach. Instead of giving up your dream of going to school, why not earn a Bachelor degree online? If you are going to take online classes, you might as well look into computer careers as well.

I have chosen three of the many options available when you earn a Bachelor degree online. Each of these careers involves computers in some shape or form. You may find that you can work from home after earning your Bachelor degree online. Like I said, there are plenty of options. The three I chose are only a small sample of what is available over the World Wide Web.

Graphic Design is a hot career that is high demand right now. Once you have earned your Bachelor degree online in Graphic Design you are well on your way to an exciting new career that you will truly enjoy. If you love art and design than this is a great field to consider. 

I like to recommend this field to art students but you don’t have to be a very talented artist to work the programs in this area. People who earn a Bachelor degree online in Graphic Design work in very exciting fields like advertising, illustration and promotional print presentations.

Another art-inspired field is visual effects and Digital Video BA programs. When you earn a Bachelors degree online in this field you are opening the doors to a dynamic world of sight and sound. If you’ve ever dreamed of working in film or in television then this is a prime choice for you.

Can’t decide which medium is right for you then you may want to consider a Multimedia Arts and Design program. I find this online Bachelor degree to be very appealing because you get to work in different media. This is a great choice for students who want a lot of variety.

People who go into the field of Multimedia Arts and Design work in a number of different mediums. They create three dimensional images, brochures, commercials among a number of other endeavors. This is a great Bachelor degree online program for someone who likes a lot of change in their workplace.

Each of these examples is appealing to people who typically are not considered technologically savvy. However, the right Bachelor degree online program will give you the training to merge your creative side with the latest technologies.
