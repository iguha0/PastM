A simple equipment should produce pictures good enough to sell,
but of course, if you own special accessories, use them!

After you have selected the field you want to specialize in and
found several magazines related to your speciality, study what
kind of pictures the editors are buying. A general description of
picture requirements is often listed in the magazines. You can
also find out by looking at the pictures used in previous issues.
Submit only the pictures you consider as good or better than the
ones being used.

Send your pictures to the Picture Editor of the magazine by
finding the address in the publication itself or in the Directory
of Trade Journals at your local library, if the publication is
not sold on newstands.

If you are a beginner, start offering standard black and white
prints, which are easier to sell because they actually are the
ones having the greatest market.

Here is how your prints should be prepared in order to sell them:

* Glossy paper is preferred. Single weight paper via cheaper and
require less postage when mailed. Pictures must be flat.

* Most publication (But not all of them) Prefer 8"x10". Check the
specific requirements of the publication before you prepare your
photos for sell.

* Number each negative, so each print you make will have a
number.

* Order a rubber stamp with your name, address, telephone number
and an extra line for the number of the picture and stamp these
informations on the back of the print you want to offer.

* Always use stiff cardboard between the prints you are mailing
to protect them, and make a neat package.

* Use kraft envelopes and always write "please don't bend" with a
red felt on the envelope to avoid any improper handling of your
pictures.

* As you cannot expect to sell all the pictures you submit,
include a self-addressed return envelope with enough postage, so
the ones rejected can be mailed back to you.

* It is not necessary to send a letter with the pictures as it
will not help to sell the pictures.

* Make sure to obtain written consent from anyone whose picture
you have taken and intend to sell. You can obtain the standard
forms called "Model Release" in many photo shops, and when you
send your picture to the editor, enclose a copy of the release
with them.


Do not offer the same picture to more than one publication at the
same time, but if your pictures are rejected by one magazine send
them to other publications.


Many amateurs are making money in this little known field. You
will be able to do the same by following the simple advices
outlined in this report.
