When a woman finds out that she’s expecting a baby girl, it’s conjures up all kinds of images. First and foremost there is the hope that the baby, regardless of its gender, will be healthy. Then thoughts move to how to decorate the little girl’s room, picking out pretty pink dresses and beaded socks. Soon to be moms also consider what name to give their new little princess.

Once the baby arrives, the parents begin their lifelong journey of raising a daughter. Although both baby boys and baby girls require constant care and attention, baby girls offer the extra challenge of picking out pretty dresses and accessories. Just walking through the infant wear department at any large store demonstrates the vast selection of little girls’ clothing that is available. 

It’s not uncommon to see a newborn baby girl all decked out in a pretty little outfit. Items like hair ribbons, beaded socks and in some cases, even small earrings are often seen on infant girls. Many mothers view their little girl as a princess from the moment she’s born and want to dress her as such. With the wide array of baby clothes available, you can dress your little one in a new dress and pair of beaded socks each and every day.

Before the baby is born many people will give you gifts. This is especially true if this happens to be your firstborn. Those closest to you want to send you something that reflects their joy in your new family addition. It’s an exciting time for a new mom and dad, as they prepare themselves for their daughter’s entrance into the world. A good idea is to have a list ready for when people ask what you need. Include the essentials on the list such as bottles, diapers and a stroller. You can also ask for some whimsical items, perhaps a pink picture frame, a pink stuffed bear and some pretty beaded socks.

Naturally you’ll want to pick out some things for the baby yourself. It’s so much fun wandering through the baby department at your local store. Seeing all the cribs, rocking chairs and baby clothes brings on a sense of excitement at the thought that your family is expanding. When you pick out outfits for your baby daughter consider buying some sleepers, a few undershirts for chilly days and some socks. Although plain ones are always fine, adding a few pairs of beaded socks to the wardrobe of an infant girl adds a nice feminine touch.
