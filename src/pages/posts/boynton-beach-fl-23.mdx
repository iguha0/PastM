American Civil War major, Nathan Boynton gave his name to the city of Boynton Beach fl after falling in love with its sandy beach, beautiful surrounding scenery and endless sunshine. The major built a summer home here, which was later to become a hotel. The area attracted settlers to its fertile land, ideal for growing fruit and vegetables. The local economy was boosted with the coming of the Florida East Coast Railway, bringing an opportunity to ship produce all over the country.

The city continues to be a pleasant place to live and work and has recovered well from the extensive damage done by Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The outdoor life is enjoyed here at a number of amenities for sport and recreation. Golf is one of the most popular pastimes and Boynton Beach fl golfers frequent The Links facility.
