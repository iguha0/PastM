When planning a wedding, one of the things that can sneak up on you is finding bridal party gifts.  Once the photographer, reception site and flowers have been chosen, you begin to realize that you have not yet decided what you will purchase as a thank you gift for your attendants.  There are now so many options that it really becomes overwhelming trying to find the perfect bridal party gifts.

The main problem that people tend to have is that they overanalyze the gift.  They tend to think that it has to be just perfect, and feel that nothing will express how much they are grateful for the participation.  This may be true, but bridal party gifts are not meant to meet that feeling, rather give a token of appreciation.  Your friendship is what is meant to be the expression of how much you appreciate the person as they are.

There are some wonderful gift options available that meet these criteria wonderfully.  Many women and men have decided to take the entire bridal party to the spa for a day of relaxation.  Unfortunately, this can easily become very expensive, but if you can afford it the spa is one of the most fantastic bridal party gifts.  Some other nice bridal party gifts that are given are bottles of wine with personalized labels, monogrammed key chains or jewelry, monogrammed cigar humidors, or even flowers.  The trend lately seems to be to give something personalized, yet get everyone in the bridal party matching gifts.

If you want to go outside of the box with your bridal party gifts, you can choose a specified amount of money to spend and purchase each member a different gift.  I have even seen where each person has gotten a different themed gift basket full of their favorite things.  These bridal party gifts are fabulous, but you need to make sure you have enough time to truly pull this off and arenâ€™t making much more work for yourself that you are unable to handle.  If you have an especially large wedding party, this route may not be the best idea.  However, if you only have a few people involved, this may be the perfect way to say thank you.

Again, bridal party gifts are simply tokens of appreciation and are not meant to be the epitome of a gift.  Generally the bridal party understands that you have just spent a lot of money on your wedding and will not be expecting a lot in terms of a present.  Take some time and make your bridal party gifts meaningful, and that is all that matters.
