Guys don’t want to seem metro sexual, but women really do appreciate a well groomed man. It let’s women know that he takes care of himself and would rather do his hair than just throw on his Yankees baseball cap. It doesn’t even take that much more time either. Waking up that extra five minutes early to throw in a little Tea Tree Defining Paste can make that much more of a difference in your confidence and your style. Let American Crew help you to become the man you always wanted to be.
