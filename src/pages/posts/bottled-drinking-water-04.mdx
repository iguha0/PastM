Call me paranoid, but I just simply do not trust our tap water.  It is really as simple as that.  I do not drink bottled drinking water because it is cheaper. In fact, drinking bottled water is a good bit more expensive.  And it is not like I've read some study that says there's lead in the local water supply.  On the contrary, according to many studies we have, if not some of the best water, at least water that is far from the worst.  It is just that having bottled drinking water makes me feel safer and more comfortable.  I feel that, since it is the health of my family that is at stake, why not get the best?  It really only makes sense â€“ everyone wants the best for themselves and their families.
Of course, I did not just get any bottled drinking water.  The fact that water is bottles does not guarantee that it is any better than your local water, and in fact it can actually be not nearly as good.  But I did bother to do the research and find what the best bottled drinking water is, and it's quality is almost amazing.  If you're getting bottled drinking water not for the taste, but for the safety, the best water that you can get is not mineral water, but distilled water.  Now there are many different grades of distilled water, but what they all have in common is that they were scientifically prepared to contain as little dissolved matter is possible.  That means that if you get distilled bottled drinking water, what you are getting is pure water with nothing else in it.  Nothing is better for your health than that, because nothing is safer than that.
I am so happy with the bottled drinking water that we got that I actually have gotten it labeled.  We have our own personalized bottled water now, which is reserved just for me and my family.  My kids might be tempted to drink drinking water straight from the tap otherwise, but now that they know that this water is for them and them alone, why would they?  It just wouldn't make any sense for them to do that!  Getting custom labeled bottled drinking water has done more to help me protect my family than anything since giving my 17 year old a nine o'clock curfew. He may resent it at the moment, but one day he will thank me.
