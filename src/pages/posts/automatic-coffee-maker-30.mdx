The no doubt about it, absolutely must have, can’t live without it appliance for anyone in the modern world has to be the automatic coffee maker. I have been an avid coffee drinker since before I could get a driver’s license. I am sure that some medical professionals would feel that I started way too early but I think it may give me a valuable perspective when it comes to coffee drinking. By this point, I think I should be viewed as an expert on the subject.

Having an automatic coffee maker in the house is a creature comfort that I cannot do without. I have had many coffee makers over the years but I recently upgraded and no one could get me to go back. Not knowing what else to give me or appreciating my addiction to the delicious coffee bean, my brother gave me a new automatic coffee maker for Christmas last year and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. 

The automatic coffee maker I received last year that has since become known as the best Christmas gift ever was made by Black and Decker. It looks like a mean machine with its stainless steel outer shell and black plastic body. It should look a bit intimidating because it can brew up a storm in a flash. The Black and Decker automatic coffee maker comes with two travel mugs that fit perfectly so you can brew a new batch of coffee right into the mugs if you are in a hurry. The mugs come with lids and all you have to do is load the machine, place the lidded mugs under it, press the button and you are good to go. 

Of course, it is an automatic coffee maker with an emphasis on “automatic.” This baby has a digital clock on the front display which is easy to set. You can program the coffee maker to brew at any hour and the pot is ready within ten minutes. I have to get up very early and have found it difficult to load a coffee maker with water and grounds without making a sleepy mess out of everything. With an automatic coffee maker you never have to worry about that again.

I highly recommend the Black and Decker automatic coffee maker. I think that it makes a great Christmas gift or anytime gift. It may be the very thing you’ve needed around the house and could be a great gift to buy yourself the next time you are out shopping.
