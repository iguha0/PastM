Have you ever stopped to consider the number of advertisements that are directed to you everyday about how you look? Some day when you get up start keeping track of the number of commercials and printed ads you see that involve a health or beauty product. The television, radio, newspapers and billboards are filled with advertisings ways that you can look and feel better and younger.

Everyone seems to be seeking the best skin care product and the best way of looking younger. The health and beauty aisle at the store is filled with lotions and potions in every color size and scent. Each one claims to be the best skin care product on the market. Then there are the products that you can only by through a private distributor. These are more expensive and are guaranteed to be the best skin care product that you will ever use.

I have found that as long as I am consistent in using any product they all work about the same. If I do a good job of washing my face and putting on a moisturizer before bed and then put on another application of moisturizer under my make up in the morning, my skin looks and feels good. Occasionally I will use a peel off masque to remove dead skin. I have found that the more lotions and potions I expose my skin to the drier it gets. In my opinion the best skin care product is consistency. People will see an advertisement or will go to a home party featuring beauty products and they will buy lotions and other skin care accessories. Because they have spent so much and have a renewed interest in how they look they will be diligent in their skin care regiment and they will look better. I believe that if they would have taken any product and used it faithfully they would have the same results. As long as you avoid harsh chemicals, which hardly any skin care products contain, you are going to get similar results from the various products. I find that if I find a lotion that I like the smell of I am more apt to put it on after my shower to help keep my skin soft. Our skin is the largest organ we have. It pays to be good to it and to keep it healthy. The best skin care product that we can use on a daily basis is protection from the sun. Sun damage not only weakens the skin but it ages it and may cause cancer. Protecting your skin from the sun and cleaning it on a daily basis will help to keep you looking good.
