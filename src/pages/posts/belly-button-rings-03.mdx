As times moves forward, new trends are consistently emerging. Surely you've noticed the "no hair" trend. While it used to be tough and manly for men to sport some chest fuzz, now it has just been deemed lame or ugly. New-age women despise chest and body hair. Or at least the majority of them do. Maybe they think it's high time men had to spend tad more time grooming. Anyway, one popular trend that is currently in full-effect is body jewelry. Take belly button rings for instance. Teenage girls and women alike are totally embracing this sensual trend. These days it's no big thing to have your naval pieced. In fact, it's actually quite appealing. 

Have you ever considered belly button rings? Naturally I am speaking to the women of the world. Although males do embrace pierced ears rather often now days, the naval jewelry is typically steered more toward the softer sex. This is probably due to the notion of exposing your naval. This is something girls embrace, but most guys avoid. Not that it has anything to do with weight issues. Most likely it has more to do with femininity. Showing off the naval has definitely been deemed a girl thing. So the question at this point is; where do you get the best belly button rings, and what styles do you prefer? One website that has plenty to offer is bodycandy.com. Here you'll discover a dashing array of belly button rings and more. Choose from fairies, to stars, to crystals, to vintage antique body jewelry. Virtually anything you can imagine to dangle from your belly button is available for purchase. More importantly, you probably won't end up paying a great deal for belly button rings. They generally range from 10 to 50 bucks, depending on what you like. Obviously if you prefer a real precious stone in your naval jewelry, you'll be paying a bit more. 

Don't overlook great websites like bodysparkle.com, bellybling.net, and MsPiercing.com. These web stores offer countless belly button rings to tickle anyone's fancy. Purchase as many as you like and switch it up day after day. Just keep in mind that you'll need to invest in a few short tops if you want others to appreciate your excellent style. Dazzling belly button rings can only be adored if you allow everyone to witness your naval bling. Go ahead and find the right naval piercing that suits your image and style.
