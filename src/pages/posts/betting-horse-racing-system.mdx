Horse Racing Betting System Essentials

Horse racing is a kind of sport that is now popularly known as a betting game. But you have to take into account that the horse racing betting does not only refer to laying a bet on the horse with the most beautiful name or the one with the best odds. In fact some people have this perception that one has to be a horse racing expert to be a winner. 

Here are some of the important things you must consider in making an effective horse racing betting system:

Distance 
The distance that will be run by the horse to reach the finishing point is a very important factor that you have to weigh up before you pick out the horse that you will lay a bet on. If the distance is short, the horse has only little time to show its best performance. Conversely if the distance of the race is too long, there are several possibilities like the horse might get tired or the horse rider might drop off. Keep in mind that the safest distance of the horse race is in the range of 5 furlongs and not more than 3 miles. 

Number of Runners
The number of runners is also a very crucial element that you should consider when betting. A horse’s chance of winning is greatly affected by the number of contenders in a race. If the field is big, then naturally, it means there’s large numbers of runners who will vie in the horse racing sport. It is quite tough to choose which horse will do well in the race where there are so many runners who compete with each other. 

The Kind of Ground
Another important factor that you should take into consideration when betting on a horse is the kind of ground in which the horse will run. The rule of thumb is that the “going” must be excellent. Examine if the ground is soft or heavy. The smoothness or firmness of the “going” is also crucial in the race.  The size of the horse’s feet has also an effect on the result of the race. 

When the Last Race was Run
The last race of the horse is also another aspect that you have to think about before you pick out your bet. You must consider when the last time the horse have its race was. It is quite difficult to tell if the horse is in good shape or not when it has been vacant in the horse racing scene for a short time. Ideally, a good bet is a horse whose last race was in the current season or at least 28 days ago. 

Check the Horses Form
You will notice that there are letters C and D indicated in the horses form. The C here indicates that the horse has been a winner over a certain track in the previous races while the D denotes that the horse has been a winner over the distance being run in the race. When there is C or D in the horses form, you should not think twice to bet on that horse. This indicates that they’re good runners.

Top Favorites
You can also consider those horses that are considered to be top favorites in the present season. Experts agree that there is a higher probability that these horses come first in the race. Hence, check out some favorites and their records in the racing field. If they have 3/1 or less in the betting, then, that’s an indication that they can be a good pick.
