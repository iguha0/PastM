The Thespian’s Guide to Acting Schools in New York

These are the facts and myths that most know or believe of the city:

New York is the city that never sleeps.
New York is one of the costliest places to live in.
New York is the center of the whole world.
New York is inhabited by people who love to love, hate, argue and haggle.

Now being a peace loving writer, I certainly shan’t argue about which one of those is true and which one isn’t. But if you’re a thespian in search for good acting schools, then you certainly won’t care about that. But you’d naturally care about the list that I’m about to provide below.

New York is a cosmopolitan city where a lot of good acting schools abound. In fact, if you truly are in search for excellent thespian education, New York isn’t a bad place to start. Naturally, the tuition fees of these acting schools are comparatively more expensive than the acting schools in your local state but they’re worth it. And if you’re looking for more proof, all you need is to do a little research work and I assure you that a lot of Hollywood big stars owe their talents to the very acting schools I’m about to enumerate.

Assuming that finances are not a problem for you, there’s just only other thing then to tackle: admissions. Several acting schools in New York are quite choosy when it comes to the students they’d let in their hallowed halls so to improve your chances of getting accepted, make sure that your school or the proper figures of authority furnish you with glowing recommendations. Neither does it hurt to have high GPAs to back you up.

With those two warnings then, here are some New York acting schools that you can try applying to.
