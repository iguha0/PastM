THE COMPLETE STREAMLINED GUIDE TO SELLING INFORMATION BY MAIL

SELLING SPECIAL REPORTS IS THE HOTTEST SELLERS IN MAIL ORDER TO
COME ALONG IN MANY YEARS AND THE BEST PART IS THAT YOU BECOME
YOUR OWN PRIME SOURCE PUBLISHER.

THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO WAYS TO SELL INFORMATION BY MAIL:
   
   1. BY PLACING ADVERTISEMENTS IN MAGAZINES AND 
      NEWSPAPERS, EITHER  CLASSIFIED OR SPACE ADS,

   2. BY RENTING MAILING LISTS AND SENDING YOUR SALES LETTER 
      TO THE NAME ON THE LIST.

HOW AND WHERE TO ADVERTISE:

THERE HAVE BEEN ENTIRE VOLUMES WRITTEN ON MAIL ORDER SELLING. FOR
PRINTED INFORMATION, THE BEST WAY TO LEARN HOW AND WHERE TO
ADVERTISE IS GO TO A NEWSTAND AND CHECK THROUGH ALL THE MAGAZINES
CARRYING LARGE NUMBERS OF CLASSIFIED AND SPACE ADS...MAGAZINES
LIKE POPULAR SCIENCE, FIELD AND STREAM, OUTDOOR LIFE,
ETC...WHEREEVER COMPETITIVE ADVERTISING APPEARS ON A REGULAR
BASIS, THAT'S WHERE YOUR BEST ADVERTISING WILL BE. THE NEXT STEP
IS TO WRITE TO THE MAGAZINES (THERE WILL BE AN ADDRESS IN THE AD
COLUMNS) AND ASK FOR THEIR CLASSIFIED & DISPLAY ADS RATE CARDS.
THESE CARDS GIVE YOU ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO PLACE AN AD.
IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL HELP, YOU CAN CALL THEM AND MOST WILL
PROVIDE COUNSEL ON HOW TO PLACE YOUR AD, WHETHER IT BE CLASSIFIED
OR DISPLAY.

HOW TO WRITE YOUR ADVERTISEMENT:

DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION YOU INTEND TO SELL BY MAIL.
eXAMPLE : FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THEN GO TO THE NEWSTAND AGAIN
AND BUY EVERY MAGAZINE CARRYING AND SELLING FINANCIAL
INFORMATION. WRITE AWAY TO THE ADVERTISERS FOR INFORMATION. MOST

OFFER.

UNIQUE APPEAL OF INTEREST TO THE EDITOR. WAYS OF OBTAINING FREE
ADVERTISING ARE DETAILED IN THE SPECIAL REPORT IN YOUR
