Although there is not universal scientific agreement on the health benefits of relaxation and meditation, anyone who has used the simple and powerful techniques thinks the same thing.  The benefits are real!  The real problem is that there is so much money to be made from anything that will make people feel better.  We are so stressed in our high energy daily lives, that even taking a few moments to clear the head can have dramatic results.  The problem is that so-called spiritual leaders will turn as to their own end.  For example, religious Christians will say that it is safe to enjoy the benefits of Christian meditation, but other forms could lead you straight into sin and damnation.  Meanwhile, proponents of transcendental meditation will claim that theirs is is the best, and look askance at anyone who does anything different than they do.

The important thing for you term member is that the benefits of meditation do not depend on which type you use, but in how you do it.  Although different schools may stress one benefit of meditation or another one, the important thing is for you just to get started.  Almost any form of meditation will work, and that is a fact.

In my experience, the best benefits of meditation are had from the most simple practices.  If you are new to meditation and want to give it a try, try something simple at first.  You do not need a teacher to reap the benefits of meditation.  A lot of people say that you do, but they are usually teachers or religious fanatics who will try to scare you with claims that if you are not properly trained, meditation can actually cause harm instead of good.  This is rubbish.  No one was ever harmed by just simply concentrating on their breathing, and this is the core of almost any good meditation.

If you want to investigate the benefits of meditation for yourself, here is what you should do: you should set aside 15 minutes every morning to just sit still and concentrate on your breath.  That is it.  There is no need to pray and invoke any particular deity, although feel free to if it makes you more comfortable.  I have tried many different forms and many different schools, and I can tell you that the full benefits of meditation can come simply from concentrating on the breath with the eyes closed.
