The other day I was curious. People have been telling me my whole life that I'm slim. Now, I've always taken this in a somewhat negative way. Sure, it's great to be slim, but no man wants to be skinny. It was high time I did a little research. All I needed for the task was my trust laptop computer. I immediately hopped online and searched for a body weight chart. These tell how much people should weigh. It's generalized of course. It's based on an average and it doesn't apply to folks who are left-handed. Okay, I actually just made up the left-handed thing. As far as I know, it does apply to all human beings. Do you currently know what your ideal body weight should consist of? 

When it comes to our weight, far too many people are sensitive. If you don't want anyone to know your weight, you're probably overweight, or at least think you are. It's time you broke out the body weight chart. It'll take you two seconds if you get online like I did. These contemporary and regularly updated charts are separated by gender. So if you're a woman, do not pay any attention to the male body weight chart and vice versa. Once you're on the body weight chart that applies to your gender, scroll down to your height and age group. These both always play a part. Even though I don't necessarily agree with the age group stuff. Being older is no excuse for being fatter if you ask me. A 50 year old can exercise just like a 25 year old. As long as they eat right and put some effort into it, they should be golden. Anyway, back to the body weight chart. There is a range in which your personal weight should fall. It runs from a minimum weight to a maximum healthy weight. Yours will probably fall somewhere in between. Mine fell about dead-center in the middle. 

Muscle is something to take into consideration if you're referring to a body weight chart. Obviously muscle weighs more than fat. If you're an avid weight lifter with 20 inch biceps, you're not in the normal male category. The average male has 13 inch biceps. Get the picture? Be open-minded when you refer to a body weight chart. It's only an average folks, and will not apply to everyone the same!
