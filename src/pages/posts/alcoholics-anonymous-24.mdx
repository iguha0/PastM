Alcoholics Anonymous

I don’t have any experience with Alcoholics Anonymous myself, thankfully, but I have known a few people who have used their program to get their life back together. I know a few people who could use it right now, but I guess it will be up to them to decide when it is time to turn their lives around. At any rate, if they don’t want to help themselves, I don’t have to be a part of their life either. It’s a two way street, though you should know that there are people who just don’t know that they have gone way too far down the wrong path.

There are a lot of jokes out there about Alcoholics Anonymous, but in reality, it’s not a laughing matter. In fact, this may be one of the most useful organizations out there. I don’t for the life of me understand why there are so many drugs out there that are illegal, yet it is perfectly legal to drink alcohol to the point where you could kill yourself or someone else. The whole point of Alcoholics Anonymous is to help those who don’t know how to limit themselves. I’m not saying alcohol should be illegal by any means, but I think there should be a better way to keep an eye on things than with sobriety tests. Once someone is in a car, it is too late.

If you have a problem, you may not be ready to admit it to anyone. You don’t have to, at least not to those you love. Just because you aren’t ready to talk to your friends and family about it, doesn't mean you can't do something about it. That’s why it’s called Alcoholics Anonymous. You don’t have to tell anyone until you are ready. It’s often hardest to admit you have a problem, but it can be even harder to admit it to everyone in your life. If you don’t want to tell anyone that you are attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, than you don’t have to.

If you don’t know where to start, you can find information on Alcoholics Anonymous online or in your local white or yellow pages. When you call them, you can be sure that no one will tell anyone you have called them. You will find that Alcoholics Anonymous will do anything they can to help you turn your life around, and they know how important it is that you might need to keep your problem to yourself until you are ready to talk to those who love you about what is going on.
