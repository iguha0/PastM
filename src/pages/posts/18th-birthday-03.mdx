Why is it that every kid wants to grow up so fast? This is an enigma to me. After all, you only get to be a child once. It commonly lasts for approximately 18 years and then it's "real world" time. Now, just to be clear, 18 years is short. It will fly by quickly. The last thing on your mind should be hurrying it along. Once you have that 18th birthday party, you're doomed to adulthood for the rest of your life. Basically what I'm getting at is, DON'T wish your life away. Trust me on this one. The early years are EASY! 

Have you had your 18th birthday celebration yet? A lot of teenagers and parents like to go all out with these ones. It's not only a celebration of making it to adulthood, but it's also a celebration for the folks, because they've been waiting so long to get you out of the house. Okay, that's just a joke. Chances are you may stay with them clear through college as well. It's not like the "old days" anymore, where the 18 year old moves out after their senior year. Kids like to stick around the home-front. It's a heck of a lot cheaper than dealing with rent and food bills during the college years. Anyone who's been there knows exactly what i mean. 

It may have just been me, but I found the whole 18th birthday party a bit frightening. Suddenly everyone expects you to act and be grown-up. Well I have to admit, on my 18th birthday I certainly didn't feel like an adult yet. This feeling actually didn't come until I was about 23. Who knows? Maybe I was a late bloomer. Regardless, 18 is what we consider the beginning of adulthood in America. Other countries may view this issue differently, but we like to be clear about it over here. 18 is when you're able to date who you please. 18 is when you're able to vote, and 18 is when you're able to get a hotel room on your own. For the most part, that 18th birthday symbolizes adulthood. But, we parents can hardly believe that our fresh high school graduates are adults yet. Okay, one thing I will tell you is to go all out for your 18th birthday celebration. Think cakes, friends, college applications, no more curfews, and a lot of relaxing. You've made it through the awkward years.
