I think that the part of the birthday party that kids look forward to the most – the part that they are really going to remember – is the birthday party favors. Of course, you should not neglect other parts of birthday decorating ideas, but the party favors are really number one. When I am going to throw a party for my little girl, Jen, I always plan it from the end to the beginning. The birthday party decorations get some attention, but the first thing that I look at really is the party favors.

Now, if she is going to have a theme party, the birthday party favors, like the birthday party decorations, really take on that theme. If, for example, I give away little Star Wars figurines as I did at her last birthday party, I am going to do it in a room with Star Wars banners as the birthday party decorations. That way, as soon as I pick out the favors, I will know what birthday party decorations I am going to have. And this is the easiest way to do it, because for me, it is much easier to figure out what the kids will like as gifts for their goody bags, then what they will like to see as birthday party decorations in the house. I mean, what little kid consciously thinks about a birthday party decoration anyway?

Well, once I have figured out the birthday favors and the birthday party decorations, all that is left to pick out is the birthday cake. This is the easy part, although it might not seem like it. My little Jen does not tell me what she wants in the goody bag, or what she wants up on the walls for birthday party decorations, but you can be that she will make her opinion heard about what kind of cake she wants to eat. After that, all I have to do is get that cake decorated in line with whatever the theme of the party is going to be, and then everything is perfect, and prepared for a nice, festive celebration. It really is not nearly as hard as you might think to have the perfect party, from birthday party decorations to birthday favors to birthday cake. It just takes a step by step approach, a little patience, and a little money, and besides that, there is nothing to it.
