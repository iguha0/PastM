5 Tips for RV Renters

Are you in the process of planning a cross-country trip to see the United States firsthand?  Or, are you in the process of planning a long distance road trip to visit friends and family?  If you are, you will want to consider traveling by RV.  There are a number of benefits to traveling long distances in a motor home.  These benefits include luxury, comfort, and having many home-like features.

As nice as it is to hear that traveling by RV is a great way to travel long distances and with large families, many are unsure about doing so.  One of the biggest concerns is the cost of buying an RV.  If you are interested in traveling by RV, but cannot afford the cost of owning one, you still have options.  RV rentals are an affordable way to gain access to a motor home.  With that being said, RV rentals can get expensive if you are not careful.  For that reason, five helpful tips for RV renters are highlighted below.

1 – Know All Of Your Options

Knowing all of your options is the best way to see success when renting a motor home.  First, examine all of your options in terms of local RV rental companies.  Many have multiple companies to choose from.  

Next, examine the types of motor homes available for rent.  For comfort, as well as safety, rent a motor home that is able to accommodate you and your traveling party.  For example, a group of six travelers should not try and squeeze into a motor home built for five.  Also examine features, such as number of electrical outlets, onboard television, movie players, and so forth.

2 – Compare Rental Prices

As previously stated, most individuals have multiple RV rental companies to do business with.  To limit the cost of your next RV trip, compare prices.  In addition to comparing the average rental price for different companies, also examine the different motor homes.  As previously stated, size is not something that you will want to be short on, but by limiting additional features, you may be able to save money.

3 – Read All Fine Print

When renting an RV, you will be required to sign a contract.  This contract is similar to one that you would sign if you were renting a car.  With that being said, never assume that all rental contracts are the same.  Always fully read an RV rental contract, including the fine print.  Never sign anything that looks too suspicious.  When in doubt, ask to take the contract home and review it first.

In keeping with reading all fine print, it is important to know all RV rental rules and restrictions upfront.  Many times, these rules and restrictions are highlighted on a rental contract, but there is no harm in asking for additional information.  Be on the lookout for any rules that may limit the number of guests allowed on board, age requirements for children, and so froth.

4 – Be Careful With Use

Being cautious is an important component of renting an RV.  If you are not careful, you may be financially responsible for any damage that occurs.  That is why you should always use caution.  Some tips involve keeping all food and drinks properly covered or put up while on the road, don’t prepare foods while driving that can cause harmful stains, and so forth.  Also, if you have children, be sure to set some ground rules.

5 – Return Your Rental On Time

Returning your RV rental on time is important for keeping your rental costs low and affordable.  Late rentals may incur late fees.  These late fees, should they exist, should be outlined on the RV rental contract.  If you know you are running behind schedule and will be late, be sure to contact your RV rental company to inform them of your delay as soon as possible.

As a recap, RV renters are encouraged to examine all of their rental options, compare prices, thoroughly read through rental contracts, use caution, and return their RV rentals on time.  These steps, when properly implemented, can not only help to improve the overall quality of your next RV trip, but they can also help to keep the costs associated with that trip reasonable.
