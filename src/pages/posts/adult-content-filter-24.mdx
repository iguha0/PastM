Adult Content Filter

I don’t need to have an adult content filter on my computer yet, but I have begun to look into them. My daughter will start school next year, and even though it may be a few years before she can learn to use the Internet, or even type, I have to think about what she might accidentally see while she is online. There are a lot of ways you can go about protecting your child, but one of the best ways is to make sure they don’t see the darker side of the world until they are old enough to understand what is going on.

Some sites on the Internet don’t need an adult content filter to pass as safe. Some are already screened by a few organizations that do nothing but check sites on the Internet. The Wiggles have a site that is safe and certified, and I’m sure many of the other children oriented sites out there will easily pass through an adult content filter. This isn’t going to help when they search however, as things can come up that they may not even read or understand, but the pictures will speak a thousand words.

You can change some of the settings on your computer that will help work as an adult content filter. Google, for example, has a safe search feature. This will work for younger children, but once a child is old enough to figure out how to change the settings, this won’t do you much good. Your computer operating system may also come with an adult content filter as well, but you should make sure you try it out before you rely on it to keep your children from the dark corners of the Internet.

Look in stores for adult content filter software, and ask a lot of questions. If the sales person can’t help you, write down the customer service number on the box, go outside the store, and then give them a call. Ask them anything you need to know. You may also ask parents in your school district if they have an adult content filter that they trust, and ask them for recommendations. As a last resort, keep an eye on the history when your child is online. This will tell you everywhere your child has been. If the history is always blank, there is a good chance your child is trying to erase or cover up their steps. See if you can set the history so that only you can delete it.
