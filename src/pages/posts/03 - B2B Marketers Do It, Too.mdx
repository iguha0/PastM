B2B Marketers Do It, Too


They use viral marketing by e-mail as a marketing tool... what did you think I meant? Viral marketing can work well for B2B providers, as long as the following is true:

1.	The product or service has to add value for the sender, as well as, the receiver.

2.	The offer has to be deliverable. You don’t want to offer a product that you can’t deliver if demand grows rapidly.

3.	The offer has to be easily transferable to others. E-mail and Web pages provide the best medium to facilitate this.

4.	The vest viral marketing campaigns use existing networks to move the message along. 

The basis of viral marketing has been around for a long time. The idea is that you incite your customers or referral sources to pass on something about your business to their network of colleagues and friends. Those that pass on your information get something in return. The something might be a gift or service related to your business. 

Using e-mail makes it incredibly easy to pass information on to a friend or colleague, especially if it involves something fun or free. With millions using the Internet worldwide, the potential for exponential growth is tremendous. The great things about viral marketing are that it is free and works virtually by itself. Once you make an offer and provide the facility for referrals, viral marketing spreads like… well… a virus…but the good kind. 

To implement viral marketing at your business; first, start with your customer base. Incite existing customers to refer new ones. Second, go to your referral sources. Service providers, your outside network and colleagues can be encouraged to provide referrals that lead to business. 

If your customers are stressed business owners, offer a reward that provides relaxation and leisure... like a weekend away.
