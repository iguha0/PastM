HOW TO GET 6,000 CIRCULARS

PRINTED AND MAILED FREE

HERE IS THE PLAN, THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO GET YOUR CIRCULARS
PRINTED AND MAILED FREE, PLUS REDUCE THE COST OF YOUR OWN MAILING
TO NOTHING.

LOCATE AN OFFSET PRINTER IN YOUR AREA, OR BY MAIL ORDER IN ONE OF
THE MANY MAIL ORDER PUBLICATIONS, WHO WILL PRINT BOTH SIDES OF A
81/2 X 11 SHEET FOR $25.0 PER 1,000, THEN RUN THE FOLLOWING AD
OVER YOUR NAME IN VARIOUS MAIL ORDER PUBLICATIONS:

"CO-OP PRINTING (our ad on back side) 1,000 
 2 1/2 X5 1/2, ONLY $ 5.00. SEND CAMERA-READY 
 COPY TO: (your name and address)."

"CIRCULARS PRINTED (our ad on back side).
1,000 3X6, ONLY $ 5.00 SEND CAMERA-READY
COPY TO: (your name and address).

ON AN 8 1/2 X 11 SHEET OF PAPER, YOU CAN GET SIX 3X6 CIRCULARS,
RECEIVED FROM RESPONSES TO YOUR AD, PLUS SIX 3X6'S ON THE OTHER
SIDE, FREE!

HAVE THE PRINTER CUT THEM INTO SIX 3X6'S, 1,000 EACH. SEND 1,000
TO EACH OF YOUR CUSTOMERS. YOU GET 6,000 OF YOUR SIDE PRINTED
FREE AND MAILED BY YOUR CUSTOMERS FREE!

SIX RESPONSES TO YOUR AD WILL GIVE YOU $30.00: $25.00 FOR
PRINTING AND CUTTING AND $ 5.00 FOR MAILING CIRCULARS TO YOUR
CUSTOMERS. WHEN PRINTING AND POSTAGE COSTS GO UP AGAIN, ADJUST
YOUR PRICE ACCORDINGLY.

CHECK THE MAIL ORDER PUBLICATIONS TO SEE WHAT OTHERS ARE GETTING
FOR SIMILAR PROGRAMS. STAY WITH THE COMPETITION IN PRICES.

THERE IS AN OTHER WAY TO GET YOUR CIRCULARS MAILED FREE. AS SOON
AS YOU CAN AFFORD IT, BECOME A SUPPLIER OF COMMISSION CIRCULARS.
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO TAKE "ALL PROFIT" OFFERS AND
HAVE CIRCULARS PRINTED ON TWO SIDES. ON THE ONE SIDE, HAVE YOUR
OWN NAME AND ADDRESS PRINTED. ON THE OTHER SIDE, LEAVE A SPACE
FOR A RUBBER STAMP IMPRINT.

OFFER THESE CIRCULARS TO CIRCULAR MAILERS ON A COMMISSION BASIS.
THEY KEEP A COMMISSION FROM 50% TO 100% ON THE ONE SIDE AND YOU
MAKE YOUR PROFIT ON THE OTHER. USE THE SAME METHOD FOR ANY OFFERS
THAT YOU DEVELOP FOR YOURSELF.

YOU CAN REACH THESE MAILERS BY ADVERTISING IN OR SUBSCRIBING OF
SEVERAL MAIL ORDER TRADE MAGAZINES AND AD SHEETS. AN OTHER WAY TO
LOCATE MAILERS FOR YOUR LITERATURE IS TO NOTICE THE ADS BY
MAILERS. USUALLY, AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR ADS THEY
STATE"COMMISSION CIRCULARS MAILED FREE", WHICH MEANS THEY GET ONE
SIDE AND YOU GET THE OTHER, AS ABOVE.

IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GE ROLLING USING THIS METHOD, TAKE TWO "
ALL PROFIT" OFFERS, ONE ON EACH SIDE, AND GIVE THE MAILER 100% ON
ONE SIDE. YOU STILL MAKE YOUR PROFIT ON THE OTHER OFFER.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN OBTAINING ADDITIONAL COMMISSION
CIRCULARS FOR YOURSELF , INCLUDE " COMMISSION CIRCULARS MAILED
FREE",IN YOUR OWN ADS.

STILL AN OTHER WAY TO GET YOUR LITERATURE MAILED FREE IS TO
INCLUDE THIS LITTLE NOTE IN ALL YOUR ADVERTISING...AT THE END OF
THE COPY..."STAMP APPRECIATED". IT ONLY COSTS YOU TWO WORDS, BUT
IT COULD SAVE YOU A GREAT DEAL IN POSTAGE. IF YOUR ARE
ADVERTISING IN TRADE PUBLICATIONS OR ADSHEETS USE "S.A.S.E" WHICH
MEANS SELF ADDRESSED STAMPED ENVELOPE. THE SAVINGS FOR ENVELOPES,
ADDRESSING LABOR AND POSTAGE CAN ADD UP FAST. MANY SMALL DEALERS
USE THIS METHOD EXCLUSIVELY, EVEN IN LARGE CIRCULATION MAGAZINES.
THEY HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS AND IT STILL WORKS!
