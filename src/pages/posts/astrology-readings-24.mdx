Astrology Readings

I get three different astrology readings in my inbox each day, and I have to laugh at how much each of them seems to contradict the others. So which is it? Which one should I rely on to get me through my day? Which one is telling the truth? Quite honestly, how can you think any of them are true if they are all so different right? This is where some people run into problems.

You should never base the course of your life on astrology readings. I’m not saying that they are worthless, but to plan your whole day around what they say is asking for trouble. What if you are thinking of asking your boss for a raise? If your astrology reading for that day says, “Now is the time to ask that big question you have been thinking about?” Does that mean today is the day you should ask for your raise? Absolutely not! You have to trust your own intuition about if the time is right. You may walk into your boss’s office only to see that he or she is having a horrible day and it is the worst time to ask for a raise. If you take the advice of your astrology reading over your common sense, you are going to get denied.

My favorite astrology reading is the one that really doesn’t try to tell me what I should do or what I shouldn’t. It’s often just advice that anyone could apply to each day of his or her life, and I find it to be uplifting for the most part. This is a great way to start my day, and this is why I love to get them. Just remember if you believe too hard you might get burned, because not everyone offering astrology readings is qualified. Anyone can claim to give you a good reading, but it doesn’t mean they know what they are doing.

If you are going through a tough time and are looking to astrology readings for help, remember not to get suckered in to paying a lot of money for something anyone could tell you. You have to be very careful about who you trust. Many people can write up astrology readings that may sound true to you, but they can sound true to almost anyone. It’s all clever wording. There are really readings out there I am sure, but how do you know you have found a genuine person? Just remember that if you want to believe some of the readings that you like, you have to also believe the ones that you may not like so much. You can get astrology readings, but just remember to use your common sense as well.
