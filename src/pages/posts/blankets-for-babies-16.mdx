There are many different kinds of blankets for babies and you may be at a loss if you are buying such an item for a special little arrival. Finding the right product might be a bit of a challenge but you can narrow down your options in a few ways. You may already have blankets for babies in mind and this is a great start.

The first thing you want to consider is the way that the items will be used. Some blankets for babies are purely decorative in nature. For example, just about every nursery has a theme and many parents choose items that suit that particular theme. Whether you like a ducky motif or a Noah’s Arc theme you can find many baby blankets with a decorative flair.

It is important to note that that many of these decorative blankets for babies are not really supposed to be used as regular bedding. The decorative baby bedding is strictly for show and should never be used when the little one is sleeping during naptime or during the night. 

This actually came as a real surprise to me. I put a Boyd’s Bear baby crib bedding set on my gift registry. I was thrilled to see that one of my relatives chose to purchase it for my baby shower. However, it was a little disappointing to come get the news that the blankets for babies in these sets should be used strictly for decoration.

I offered great appreciation for the lovely gift and my sister (who made the thoughtful purchase) added, “You know that these blankets for babies are for decoration only.” I then offered my surprise. Of course, the manufacturer added this note on the packaging but many moms might not notice. 

Since my sister is a nurse at Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania she has a pretty good grasp on these kinds of things. Instead of using the beautiful blankets for babies as regular bedding, I used them strictly for decoration.

Fortunately, my sister bought an additional gift for my little one. She chose a couple wearable blankets for babies that are designed for safe sleeping. This additional present turned out to be a very valuable addition. The wearable blankets for babies are great because they can go everywhere with us. 

I’m glad that we have such a great relative who takes the details into consideration. I will never look at blankets for babies the same way again.
