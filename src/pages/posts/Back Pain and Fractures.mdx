Back Pain and Fractures 
How it is defined: 

Fractures are defined in medical terms as breaks in the permanence of bones. However, several types of fractures doctors consider before diagnosis is set. The types of conditions include thirteen different types, such as pathologic, complete, avulsion, incomplete, compressed, comminuted, depressed, greenstick, oblique, simple, spiral, compound, and transverse. Greenstick is a fracture of the bones, which often occurs at a youthful age. In this instance, one side of the bone is broken or out of order while the other side is curved or bent. 

How doctors treat fractures is based on the findings, since few fractures may include damage of the hips. Intertrochanteric, intracapsular, and extracapsular is the modes of hip fractures doctors consider. In addition, yes, hip fractures cause back pain. 

When doctors consider back or hip fractures they often consider trauma, maturity, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, multiple myeloma, immobility, steroids, Cushing syndrome, malnutrition, bone tumors, and so on. 

Osteomyelitis is a bone disease, which causes inflammation of bones and marrow. The problem often starts with infections. Osteoporosis is also a bone disease, which occurs amongst women, especially after menopause. The bones after menopause often become highly permeable or porous, which causes easy breaks and slow healing processes. 

Once the doctor finds the cause, Pathophysiology is considered, which includes assessment of the fracture itself. Does the fracture transpire at what time stress is pressed on the bones, which the bones cannot hold the weight? Doctors will consider if they are capable of localizing the tissues around the injuries to avert edema, muscle spasms, ecchymosis, hemorrhage, nerve compression and so on. 

Edema then will cause back pain, since it is excessive fluids that buildup between the cells of tissue. Ecchymosis is the fleeting of blood that travels into groups of cells into an organism (Tissues), which are caused from ruptured, or breaks of blood vessels. 

How do they assess? 
Doctors usually assess fractures by reviewing false motions, pain caused from motion, edema, tenderness, immobility, crepitus, deformity, ecchymosis, paresthesia, and so on. If one leg is apparently shorter than the other is, likely a fractured hip is the cause. Paresthesia often causes tingling, creeping, or pricking sensations, which usually an obvious cause is not present. 

How do doctors find fractures? 
Doctors often use Hematology tests or X-rays to find fractures. X-rays helps the doctor find breakage in continuity of the bones, while Hematology assists in spotting decreases in HCT and Hgb. 

Once the doctor notes the medical condition, he/she will recommend medical supervision, nurse interventions, etc to treat the condition. Management often includes diets, exercise, etc, yet it depends on the type of fracture. 

DO not try this at home unless your doctor has authorized treatment first. 

Diet of any kind is ok, so many think, yet some people lack vitamins, minerals, etc, while others have high loads. The diet set up from fractures may include high protein diet, high vitamin, low calcium, and increases in fluids. It is amazing that a doctor would request low calcium diets, especially when calcium is essential for building bones, yet in some instances low volumes of calcium is mandatory. 

Management may include elevation of the legs, especially if the patient has a hip fracture. Exercise includes ROM and isometric. Stretch exercises are best suited for back injuries. 

Hip injuries can cause back pain. If doctors find fractures it could lead to complications, such as pressure sores, “deep vein thrombosis,” avascular tissue death or necrosis of the femoral top, renal (Kidney) lithiasis, hypovolemic shock, fat and pulmonary (Lungs) embolism, osteomyelitis, cubicle syndrome, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia.  

Osteomyelitis, cubicle syndrome, and dead tissues, or avascular necrosis is clear indications that fractures are present.
