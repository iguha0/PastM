How Do I Choose the Right Site For Me?


With the explosion of online dating sites has come a virtual smorgasbord of choices. There are free sites… I don’t recommend those but if money is a real concern, they are better than nothing. There are the large paid sites with many and varied features like chat, IM and even matching using profiles. There are the less expensive paid sites with few features. There are special interest sites for almost any thing you can think of...outdoor enthusiasts, couch potatoes, religious, non-religious, gays, lesbians…like I said…almost anything you can think of. So what’s a girl to do? A girl should choose the site or sites that best fit her needs. 

Here are some things to consider:

(1)	Cost. How much do you want or how much can you spend each month for your membership (s)?  
(2)	Features. Which features are the most important to you? 
(A)	Profile matching systems. Is this a feature you really want or would you rather decide who is right for you all by yourself?
(B)	Chat and IM’s? There are websites who offer chat rooms and IM’s on their sites. Does that matter or would you be happy just sticking to private email. 
(C)	Outside Events…such as speed dating? Are you interested in that?
(D)	Privacy. Some websites allow you to limit who can view your picture or your profile. Does this matter to you or do you want as wide exposure as you can have? 
(E)	Safety. There are websites who do background checks of all subscribers and certify their age, marital status and background. Would you feel safer using this feature? 

These are a few things but not all things you should consider when choosing an online dating service or services. Do your homework and choose wisely for the best results for you.
