If you are going to stay at home and rent a movie this weekend, you would do well to check for blockbuster coupons out there, because they have been doing a lot of promotions lately. Some of them are in the paper, while other ones of them are on the Internet, but either way it is easy to find a blockbuster promotional coupon that will save you money when you rent. I think that it depends on what is your local video store and whether or not they offer a blockbuster coupon. If they do, it can save you a lot of money off of your next rental, but if they do not, you would do better to go to another video store. Unless all that you watch is the newest of the new releases, blockbuster video has a really lousy selection, if you ask me.

Of course, getting yourself a blockbuster coupon can sometimes really save you a whole lot of money, especially if you are a movie buff like I am. The current blockbuster coupon allows you to get six movies for the price of one. Although you can only use this blockbuster coupon once per customer, it is just a snap to get around it. You just add a friend to your account, have him use the blockbuster coupon to rent your movies for you, and then take him off of the account as soon as he is done. He can probably even use the same blockbuster coupon from his own account after!

Of course, blockbuster coupons are not the only way to save money using the Internet. There are all kinds of money saving coupons available. One of the best ways outside of a blockbuster coupon to save money is to look at what local businesses are opening. More often than not, if you come in on or near opening day, they will be able to save you a lot of money, by letting you use a coupon of their own. A new restaurant will often do this, giving you two meals for the price of one, or some similar deal. Even chains do this. When the new Blockbuster video opened, they actually had a special Blockbuster coupon for that store only for a month of unlimited rentals for something like twenty or thirty bucks. Boy, was that ever worth it! I have never watched so many movies in my life.
