Blowing Bubbles	

When summer comes, there is only one thing on my daughter’s mind. She wants to go outside to start blowing bubbles. She’s not concerned with going for a walk to see the newly emerging flowers, and she’s not interested in riding her bike. She wants to start blowing bubbles and she wants to do it now. There is something about bubbles that makes a child squeal with delight, and I guess I should never begrudge her that type of happiness. Even as she gets older, blowing bubbles is something she always seems to want to do.

I tried to let her blow bubbles in the house. At first I said she could just do it in her room. This was a mistake, because she spilled the bubbles all over the place. I don’t know if you have ever had to clean up bubbles from a hardwood floor, but I can tell you it is not as easy as you might think. Bubbles are mostly soap, and when there is a lot of soap, it’s hard to clean up. The floor was cleaner after that though, at least something good came out of it.

I then allowed her to start blowing bubbles in the bathtub. This worked out for a while, but I started to notice spots on the wall. You might say I’m not a good duster, and her habit of blowing bubbles in the bathtub highlighted that point for me. There were spots everywhere that collected the dust I neglected, and I had to clean the entire room from ceiling to floor. It’s ok though, as it really needed it. After awhile, I had to stop her from blowing bubbles anywhere in the house, however, because the floor just got too slippery.

So now we save bubble blowing for the spring and summer, but she doesn’t complain too much. I just make sure when the weather turns too cold for blowing bubbles that I put them away where she can’t see them. Out of sight is really out of mind. On occasion she remembers that she wants to blow bubbles, but for the most part, she is young enough to be redirected to something else rather easily. Once she forgets about the bubbles, I have at least a few weeks before she remembers them again, and this is plenty of time to think of a new game to play to take her mind off of her bubble obsession.
