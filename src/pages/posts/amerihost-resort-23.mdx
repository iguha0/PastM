Since their instigation in 1989, the hotel chain of Amerihost Inns have given excellent service to a loyal core of customers. The Amerihost resort chain operates in 22 states in America and Canada and offers consistent amenities in all their branches. Travelers and business people can encounter problems on the road and it's good to have a brand that they know they can rely on. 

Loyalty is duly rewarded with the company's loyalty points scheme. These points can be redeemed against free stays in any branch in the country or for free air miles. They also can be used towards resort vacations, as gift certificates and for products, such as electronic goods, appliances and sports goods. Some customers like to redeem them for theme park or movie tickets. At every stay, as each dollar is spent, 10 points are earned. For air miles, 2 miles are earned each dollar or 2 rail points. There is also a rewards master credit card on offer.

Some hotel chains tend to be impersonal but the Amerihost Resort inns pride themselves on being smaller and therefore, able to achieve a more intimate and welcoming ambience. There are standard amenities across the group that include complimentary continental breakfast, a large indoor swimming pool, in room clock radio and electronic door locks. All rooms are non-smoking and some branches have a whirlpool in addition to the swimming pool.  Upgrades for the suites are available, such as a refrigerator, hairdryer, microwave oven, iron and ironing board and an in room coffee service.

Discounts on room rates are available where eligible. Senior citizens over sixty years of age and government employees are discounted, as are group bookings that book 10 or more rooms. Members of AARP also receive a discount of up to 10%. Amerihost Resort Inns organise travel packages for the convenience of customers. In addition to the hotel reservation, staff will book flights or car rental. Car hire offers a selection of any class of vehicle, including economy, standard, luxury, convertible or SUV.

The web site for the company is user friendly, making it very easy for anyone to make reservations at an Amerihost Resort Inn or to find out about current special offers. Customers can use the location search facility to find the one they need. Amerihost like to run competitions with big prizes. The current competition has vacations for winners in Ireland and the Caribbean. There is also a golfing vacation in Orlando to win and a Californian road trip.
