Acid Reflux Disease

For the longest time I thought I might have acid reflux disease. I don’t think I did now that I don’t have any more problems, but for the longest time I had some of the symptoms. For the longest time I had horrible heartburn for most of the day, and it really didn’t matter what I ate. I began to worry about the consequences of having acid where it shouldn’t be day in and day out, but no matter what I did with my diet, the problem remained.

Looking back, I think my brush with acid reflux disease was because of all of the stress in my life. At the time I had a horrible job that I hated, my relationship was more bad than good, and I missed my family very much. As soon as I made the decision to take a vacation alone to see my family, and then made the choice to go back to school to get out of my horrible job, my symptoms of acid reflux disease disappeared and I have not had a huge problem since.

If you have any symptoms on a day to day basis, you may want to talk to your doctor about acid reflux disease. This is not only just a pain for you when you are experiencing heartburn. It can also mean that some of your esophagus is being eaten away by the excess acid. This can cause permanent damage. There are medications out there now that can help eliminate your symptoms and some claim to repair some of the damage caused by acid reflux disease. I don’t know if these claims are true, but it would be in your best interest to talk to your doctor.

If you aren’t sure what the symptoms of acid reflux are, you can find them easily enough if you look online. If you have heartburn at times when there seems to be no cause, and if you have it more than once or twice a week, you should consider that you might have to see someone for help. Acid reflux disease will be different for everyone, though not everyone will be able to get rid of it by simply changing his or her life like I did. When there has been a lot of damage to your stomach and esophagus, you may need more than a medication so much sure you call your doctor for an appointment once you suspect a problem.
