As a teacher, American heart association cpr training is more than an extra bit of information that I can put on my CV or resume. It is a necessity. A teacher is not just responsible for education, although this is the main thing that teachers have to do. But a teacher also must look after the health and well-being of all of his or her students. Those kids are responsible to you for their very lives and you must do what is necessary to take care of them if things do ever go wrong. This is why it is so crucial for a teacher to get American heart association cpr course training. Because, if God forbid something does happen and a child chokes, has a severe allergic reaction, or even has a heart attack, it is up to you to do whatever you can to make sure that they come through it alive. They will be counting on you – do not let them down.

Honestly, with the ease with which someone can go and get American heart association cpr courses, I do not understand why it is not a universal thing. In many schools offices, and other places of business, they will even pay for you to get American heart association cpr certified. All it takes is a few hours of your time. And it really is no more than a few hours. The American heart association cpr training is so simple that anyone can do it, yet something as simple as that can really save a life when it comes down to the line. If you can be ready to save a line when the time comes, shouldn't you? There is no excuse not to, especially not since September 11th.

Everyone at some time dreams about becoming a hero. American heart association cpr training has given more than one person the chance to go and be just that. As a matter of fact, I have a friend who is now an American heart association cpr teacher. He was just a normal professional – a banker I think, who was responsible to get certified in American heart association cpr. When one of his coworkers had a heart attack, he was there to administer cpr. Thanks to him, that coworker is still alive. He was so moved by the experience that he now teaches American heart association cpr. Although he makes less money, the experience is so much more enriching that he does not care.
