Are High End Filter-Free Air Purifiers Really a Better Deal?

Whether you watch television, read magazines, or use the internet, there is a good chance that you have seen advertisements for air purifiers that do not require the use of replacement air filters.  These advertisements often claim that you can save a considerable amount of money overtime with the purchase of a filter-free high end air purifier.  Although this is true in many cases, many consumers are left wondering if air purifiers that do not need replacements are really a good deal.

When it comes to determining if filter-free air purifiers are really a good deal, there are a number of important points that you will want to take into consideration. These points, a few of which are touched on below, can help you decide what type of high end air purifier you should purchase for your home.

One point that you will want to take into consideration is your use.  Are you looking to temporarily clean the air, like if you have family staying at your home for about a week or two?  If one of those family members is a smoker or if a family pet will be coming too, you may not need to invest in a high end filter-free air purifier.  This is because filter-free air purifiers do work, but they are costly.  With that being said, their costs do pay off overtime.  This is because you do not have to purchase potentially costly replacement filters.  However, if you do not plan on using a filter-free air purifier on a daily basis, the extra costs may not be worth it to you.

When looking to purchase a high end filter-free air purifier, how much you are willing to spend upfront should also be taken into consideration.  As previously stated, air purifiers that do not need replacement filters, especially those that are considered high end systems, do cost more money.  Depending on the brand and where you make your purchase from, you could easily spend thousands of dollars on a high end filter-free air purifier.  As previously stated, can see a return on your investment in a few years, but it is important that you first have the money to spend.  If not, you should still examine high end air purifiers, as they are known for their strength, durability, better and long lasting results, but those with filters tend to be more affordable.

Another important point to take into consideration when looking to buy a high end filter-free air purifier for the home is quality.  Since filter-free air purifiers make the most out of new technology and they are known for their results, many assume that they are all considered high end products.  This isn’t necessarily true anymore due to knockoffs.  Many companies have seen how well filter-free air purifiers have sold, so they try to make their own.  Unfortunately, many do not use quality materials or the same technology.  That is why you will want to make sure that you purchase a true high end filter-free air purifier.  One great way to do this is by using the internet to your advantage.

When looking to research high end filter-free air purifiers, you will want to perform a standard internet search.  If you already have a make and model in mind, perform your standard internet search with that information.  If not, you should use search phrases like “air purifiers with no filters,” “high end filter-free purifiers,” or “best filter less air purifiers.”  The results that you will find may be links to websites were air purifiers are being reviewed or sold.  Wherever your internet search takes you to, be sure to read reviews online and examine ratings.  This will help to ensure that you spend your money wisely.

Finally, the space that you need to clean should be examined.  Are you looking to clean the air in one or two rooms or your whole house?  It is also important to examine the CADR.  This is the Clean Air Delivery Rate.  This is the rate in which an air purifier can clean the air inside your home.  It is best if you choose a high end air purifier with a higher CADR.
