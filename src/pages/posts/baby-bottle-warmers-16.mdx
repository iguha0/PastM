Anyone who has woken in the wee hours of the morning for an urgent infant feeding knows the importance of baby bottle warmers. These helpful items can save time and energy and they provide a safe approach to warming formula and breast milk for the little one. Choosing the right brand is crucial in order to assure satisfaction with the product.

There are a number of baby bottle warmers on the market today. You can find and array of this kind of product in a number of styles and sizes. They also come in a wide range of prices. Whenever prices vary a great deal in a certain type of product you are sure to have to do a little research before making a purchase. This goes for baby bottle warmers as well.

When I was choosing items for my baby shower gift registry I visited a few stores. I decided to choose baby items from Babies R Us and Target. Both of these retail chains offered excellent products at reasonable prices. However, I really didnâ€™t research baby bottle warmers at all before making a choice. 

I simply chose the least expensive product. I learned the hard way that not all baby bottle warmers are created equal. The one I chose was really awful and I have a list of reasons why. First of all this is probably the only one of the baby bottle warmers that heats the mild unevenly. 

Nothing is more surprising than ice cold milk followed by very warm milk on your wrist at 2 AM in the morning. For some reason this baby bottle warmer only heated the very bottom of the bottle. Actually, the reason is quite clear. The steam covered the bottom and never had a chance to really heat the top.

The milk was never so hot that it would scald or harm the infant but I did wind up just soaking the bottle in hot water to heat it up. I decided to look into my options in baby bottle warmers instead. After a little reading I discovered that all units were indeed not created equal.

I did wind up investing more than I wanted in the baby bottle warmers but I really think that it was worth it in the end. The new item is pricy but you do get what you pay for in some cases. When it comes to my baby I am definitely going to research before buying, especially if the price is too good to be true.
