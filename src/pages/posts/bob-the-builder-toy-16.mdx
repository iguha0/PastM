Kids love to play with just about any Bob the Builder toy. This loveable character comes with an array of building buddies who work together as a team. The overall theme of this kind of play thing is confidence. This may not be apparent to some but any child who has played with a Bob the Builder toy comes out with a “can-do” attitude.

I love that my kids work together when playing with this building buddy inspired set of toys. Nothing brings fighting boys together like a Bob the Builder toy. The kids spend hours with this character and while they are inspired by the show that airs on television every day, they are also quite inspired to use their own imaginations as well.

Problem solving skills are extremely important in a child’s development and a Bob the Builder toy is the perfect tool for teaching these kinds of skills. The boys solve problems, build things and work together like a well oiled machine. The Bob the Builder toys are great learning tools that teach skills that can be used in everyday situations outside of play.

This line of products comes in an array of shapes and forms. Sure, the bedding, backpacks and dinnerware are fantastic accessories and I wouldn’t part with a single one. However, there is one Bob the Builder toy that really stands out of the pack as far as I’m concerned. 

The Take Along Gift Pack is the perfect Bob the Builder toy for any family on the go. My kids pack up their respective sets and take them just about everywhere we go. The set is fantastic because it is filled with nine, yes, nine, toys that are small enough for travel but big enough for big fun. 

This Bob the Builder toy is great because parents can get all of the favorite characters in one fell swoop. The construction vehicles are made of durable die cast and they are virtually indestructible. They take a lot of abuse and they have seen many, many miles of excitement. The carrying case keeps each Bob the Builder toy safe and snug in its own compartment. 

Of course, this is a favorite for my kids, too. They are happy to share the crew. After all, the whole theme is working together with confidence. I love that the boys run around saying, “Can we fix it? Yes we can!”  There are few toys that have the affect of a Bob the Builder toy.
