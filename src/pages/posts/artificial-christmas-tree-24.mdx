You may not want to worry about having a real tree for the holidays, and if you don’t want one, you are not alone. They are great, but they can be hard to care for if you buy the wrong one. I know that I have a hard time remembering to water mine, and that means the needles are all over the place before the tree has been in my home for more than a few days. That’s a mess that can be hard to clean up. Though I have not yet bought an artificial Christmas tree, I am beginning to think it is a very good idea in my case, and I can see why so many get them.

You may also have a problem with your real tree even if you can remember to keep the water levels where they should be so the tree has all that it needs. Some that sell real trees are really good about giving you fresh ones, and taking care of them before they go home with you. However, there are times when you may buy one that is starving for water, and no matter what you do, the needles will fall off. Sometimes, your poor tree can be almost bald before the big day even arrives. That might be all the advertisement you need to get an artificial Christmas tree when the holidays come around next year.

What is great about the artificial Christmas tree is that you don’t have to buy ones that don’t look good any longer. Some of them are so nice you can not tell that they are not real unless you get really close to them or touch them. They may not have the same smell, but you can always get a pine scented candle to light now and again when you miss the natural aroma of a fresh cut pine tree. When you have a great looking one, you can use it year after year if you wish, and you only have to pay the initial investment when you buy it in the store.

Don’t forget that you can get more than just an artificial Christmas tree these days. You can find some that come already lit, and that can take a bit of the hard work out of decorating your tree each year. Though hanging the ornaments might be fun for you and your family, the lights are quite often a pain. If you can skip that with a pre-lit tree, that might be the way to go. Some even come with decorations already in place, but if you enjoy decorating, that might not be the tree for you. However, with so many to choose from, the perfect tree is out there just waiting for you to find it.
