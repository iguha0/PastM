Beginners Golf

When my husband took up golf, I was happy to get him out from underneath my feet. There is nothing worse than a bored husband roaming around the house. They either bug you to death about finding something to do, or they end up fixing things that don’t need fixed. Once he started playing golf, it was much more peaceful in my home. What surprised me was that I became interested in learning how to play, so he took me to the driving range for some beginners golf lessons. I was not prepared for the frustration.

What you don’t realize about beginners golf is that it might take you forever just to figure out how to stand and hold the club correctly. Forget about trying to get that ball into the hole, you have a long way to go before you can attempt that, at least if you are as bad as I am. Once I finally got the stance right, I swung. He said I had a good slice, but I guess I’ll just have to take his word for it. What was even more disheartening were the children around me also trying out beginners golf. They were so much better than I was.

Beginners golf isn’t all about the stance and the swing though. Once you kind of get the hang of that, you then can worry about where your ball is going. My husband informed me that I had to hit the putt-putt course, and this was the second part of beginners golf that would have me frustrated. It seems so easy to hit the little white ball, but in reality it is very hard to get it to go where you want. You misjudge your own strength. You’d be surprised where those balls can go if you swing too hard.

The biggest beginners golf less on I learned was that I am not as patient as I thought I was. In fact, I was filled with frustration. I can’t imagine why anyone thinks golf is relaxing, and I would imagine my stress levels would get worse, not better, if I continued to play. I suppose I should give it another go, however, because perhaps once you get past beginners golf you will find more fun in the game. Until then, I will continue to dream of little white balls and plot my revenge against that stupid windmill that just wouldn’t let my ball go through.
