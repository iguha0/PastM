American Presidents

The President of the United States holds the highest office in the country, and is the Chief Executive in charge, presiding over both the Congress and the House of Representatives. Since the first American President, George Washington, took office on April 30, 1789, forty-one more presidents have been sworn into office for a collective total of forty-three presidencies. The match doesn’t work does it? This is why; Grover Cleveland, the twenty-second president was also the twenty-fourth president who served two separate terms, and the only president to do so. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States was the only American president elected to four consecutive terms covering the Great Depression, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and World War II. He died shortly after the start of his fourth term of office from a stroke in 1945.
