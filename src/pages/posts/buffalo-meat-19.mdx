My husband is an avid hunter and fisherman. He enjoys a wide range of hunting and fishing. We live on a lake so we have fresh fish often. We also train hunting dogs, so we go out bird hunting for both upland game as well as water fowl. This means that our freezer is usually filled with a wide assortment of wide game to prepare. Three years ago a friend of ours began raising buffalo. He asked us if we would be interested in purchasing a half of buffalo when they butchered the meat. We told him that we would think about it and get back to him, because we did not know a great deal about buffalo meat. He told us that we could share the half with someone else if we were concerned about the amount of meat.

We did some research on buffalo meat and found that it is very lean and is lower in cholesterol that beef. The meat also is easier for the body to digest and is lower in calories than beef. We called my brother in law and he agreed that they would be interested in trying a quarter of the buffalo. They have a teenage son, so they go through a great deal of meat. Our friend that was raising the buffalo told us that he would call us at butchering time so we could contact the locker to let them know how we wanted the buffalo meat wrapped.

We had no idea what size the steaks would be so we asked to have them individually wrapped. We asked for roasts the size to feed four people and the burger to be wrapped in one pound packages. When we went to pick up the meat we each received forty five pounds of burger and a wide variety of steaks. The steaks were tenderized at the locker because the buffalo meat has a tendency to be tougher than beef due to the massive shoulders of the buffalo.

The first night we brought the buffalo meat home we grilled two t-bone steaks. They were absolutely wonderful. The flavor was great and with the tenderizing the meat was so tender that it could be cut with a butter knife. We immediately decided to place our order for the next year so that we could have a steady supply of the buffalo meat. The burger is very lean and tasty. There is no wide game taste to the meat that the venison and antelope has. Buffalo meat has added a great and healthy taste to our menu.
