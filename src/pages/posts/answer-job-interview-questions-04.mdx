Preparing for job interview questions can be one of the most difficult and nerve-racking experiences. On the one hand, you know that you have to hit an interview perfectly. You want this job, and you can feel in your bones that you are the right candidate for it. It all comes down to this one interview, so you have to give it everything you've got. On the other hand, you have no idea what to look at. How do you study for an interview? How do you know if you answer job interview questions well or not?

In reality, just practicing can help you. Answering job interview questions is as much a matter of feeling comfortable on your feet as of having the correct answer. Although a lot of job interview questions books will give you different specific tips on what types of answers an employer is looking for, they will all tell you this: you have a better chance of getting the job If you appear confident.

This is why you should answer job interview questions with a friend before the actual interview. Practicing questions and answers alone can be helpful, but practicing with a partner can be even better. A partner will help you simulate actual interview conditions. He or she can tell you whether or not you seem calm, confident, and comfortable with the interview. He can give you tips on eye contact, posture, facial expressions, and any other pointers you might need.

The problem is, finding out the right answers for job interview questions is difficult. You see, every employer looks for something different. I worked in human resources for five years, so I know a little bit about the subject.  Basically, there are several things that I look for from someone who I am interviewing. Of course, he or she has to answer job interview questions in an honest, straightforward manner and with confidence, but it goes beyond that.  I want someone who is honest. There are usually pat, safe ways to answer job interview questions, but sometimes you can get better results by straying a little bit from the standard responses. If you can illustrate your points with a really interesting story from your own experience, it will make an even better impression. Basically, the most important thing is to engage your interviewer. If you can make him or her like you, you have the job!
