I seriously doubt you will find too many individuals or families on this planet who aren't trying to find that ideal location. You know the one. There's no denying that we would all like to reside in a specific place that caters to our preferences. One where the weather is perfect, according to our personal definition of perfect, of course. One where all the amenities we enjoy are nearby. One where we can rest assured that our children are safe and the schools are great. Now, that just about sums it up. Naturally, on the other side of the coin there is something called affordable real estate. Whether or not you can have it all is certainly questionable. I've not found that spot yet. The few that appeared to have it all were definitely not in my price range. I'm not looking for a $5000 a month house payment. Needless to say, there's much that goes into finding an ideal place to live. 

Where do you currently reside? How would you rate your area? Just imagine for a moment, on a scale of 1-10. You can even make a pros and cons list. Is affordable real estate one of the pros? I can say that it is where I currently reside. On top of that, the area is safe and the schools are great. That's a lot for me to give up. In all honesty, schools and safety are my greatest priorities. The fact that we encountered affordable real estate is a mere plus. Then again, we probably wouldn't be here if we hadn't. Now, I do realize that the words "affordable real estate" mean different things to different people. Some may consider 100 grand affordable, while others are thinking along the lines of 400 grand. So much rests on your house-hold income. One thing you will find is depending on where you choose to live; your quality of living can increase dramatically with the right location. 

Having difficulties deciding where to buy that home? It's time for some recon work. All it takes is your personal computer and Internet access. Sort through various states and cities to get a better grasp on which areas offer affordable real estate. This is how I found my current home. Let the World-Wide-Web do most of the work for you.
