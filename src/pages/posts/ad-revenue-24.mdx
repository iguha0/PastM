Ad Revenue

If you want to make money on the Internet, there are a great many ways to do so. You can write, like I do, or you can own a business that supplies goods or services. You can also make money via ad revenue, and this is a route that many have chosen to take. Sometimes, all you need is a website with some keyword dense articles and an ad revenue program like Google’s Adsense and you are good to go. There are many who make money this way, and they make a lot of money.

There are tricks to it, and it isn’t as simple as slapping up a website and repeating some keywords. Google is always working to better enhance their search engine capabilities to give searchers more relevant results. You really have to study the rules of their ad revenue program and how their search engine works before you can make a go of it. You have to be sure search engines find your content, but you also have to be careful you are not producing spam.  

Google isn’t the only way to make money from ad revenue online. Take the site www.pogo.com for example. Pogo has online games that you can play, and many of them have a cash jackpot you can win. They make most of their money on ad revenue from the various ads you see all over their site. They have a subscription fee so you can join and not have to look at the ads, but I suspect the ad revenue is where they get most of their profits. People pay money every time their ad is viewed, and this can mean good money for a site with a lot of traffic.

If you want to make money with ad revenue, do your research and decide how much time and effort you have to put into it. If you need content, you can always hire some writers, but you have to make sure they know what they are doing. If you need a website, you can have someone build it for you. Ad revenue will only come if you have visitors on your site, so make sure you shell out some cash for your own ads, and make sure you network and promote your site. If you can’t get people there and Google and the other search engines can’t pick you up, your venture into ad revenue is going to be a loss.
