Many towns grew up around the Colorado River and Bullhead City Arizona is one such town, situated in Mohave County, just north of Fort Mojave Indian reservation. The town takes its name from a rock formation on the river, called Bull's Head Rock. The townsfolk enjoy an active calendar of events, including the monthly Art in the Park meeting that takes place in the Community Park. It's an opportunity for local artists to display their work and meet the public.

Sport too is on the agenda and it's a great family day out at the annual Senior Softball Tournament. Each winning team from every division is given an award and all team members receive a T-shirt as a memento. The first Bullhead City Arizona River Regatta was held in August 2007. This proved so successful that there are plans to hold it every year.

The natural world can be explored at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Hikers enjoy the desert terrain and can join ranger led groups. The large lakes are a great place for fishing, swimming and boating. Bullhead City Arizona is a good base to explore the surrounding area, including the Grand Canyon. The canyon receives thousands of visitors a year, attracted by the colorful rock strata and vast scale of this geological wonder. The gorge reaches a maximum depth of 1,600m and hikers and bird watchers are amongst the visitors. Many people like to go boating on the river and white water rafters enjoy the rapids.

The Colorado River Museum has exhibitions and collections that explore the local history of the population that settled in the area. The Mojave Tribes were the first inhabitants and many of their artifacts are on display. There is also a replica Mojave village. Pottery and photographs trace the history further and there are models of old steamboats. Many people settled in the Bullhead City Arizona area for what was under the ground and there are displays depicting life in a gold mine and a collection of minerals and gemstones. The beginning of modern life as we know it today is shown in the town's first switchboard system. The museum also houses the Old River Church Wedding Chapel, where today's townspeople can hold their ceremonies.

The Arizona Veteran Memorial Park contains a Trail Of Memories pathway with inscriptions to loved ones and the Memorial Plaza monument is dedicated to 3,000 servicemen and women who served in World War I and subsequent campaigns. The park pays tribute to members of the Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and prisoners of war.
