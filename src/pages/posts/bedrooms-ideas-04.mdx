I have always loved interior decorating. Decorating or remodeling the house has always been one of my favorite hobbies because it gives me such an opportunity for self-expression. Although I'm not much of a painter, I do need an artistic outlet. My home serves as that artistic outlet. Still, because I entertain clients at my house, in a lot of places I can't really let my whimsy run free. I have to make things look conventionally acceptable in most of my rooms. The one exception to that is my bedroom. I can use any bedrooms ideas that I want, and it is okay. After all, only me and my life ever see it.

Up until recently, I didn't use any unconventional bedrooms idea. We were newly married, and both were trying to be as accommodating as possible. As such, I did not get to push the limits with my decorating at all. Since then, all of that has changed. It started out pretty simply. I put up sconces on the wall. That has always been one of my favorite bedrooms ideas. Candles are so romantic, and the wall seems like an ideal place for them. After all, when you put up candle holders on the wall, you ensure even light all over the bedroom.

I thought that my wife would be a little bit hostile to the project, but to my surprise she really liked it. She agreed that it was romantic, and she found that it provided a very nice, soft light that we could use for reading. I took this as permission to let my bedrooms ideas go wild. Since that day, I have done all kinds of different experimenting. Of course, I started off by buying some new linens for the bed. I bought expensive Egyptian cotton sheets, something that I considered a worthwhile investment. After all, having a comfortable night of sleep is one of the most important things that there is. I also bought a brightly colored down comforter, printed with pictures of animals, flowers, and exotic forest scenery. Somehow, it brightened up the whole bedroom.

My most extravagant bedrooms ideas, however, had to do with how I decorated the walls. I have decided to use ceramic tiles instead of the normal wallpaper. At first, my wife objected. She thought that it would be a little bit too busy, but once I started really designing a nice ceramic mosaic, she started to really like it.
