Any fool can see that our red, white and blue country has issues with weight gain. We may be the land of the free and the home of the brave, but we're also overweight. This has got to change on a major level or there isn't going to be any more room for others in this country. That whole issue with the commercial airliners and the seating was a hint if I ever saw one. What about you? Do you think individuals who are too overweight should pay for two seats? If this question makes you angry, then my guess is you're overweight. That's typically how our human emotions work. Regardless, even if this country is not interested in dropping pounds for reasons such as this, you could always do it for the most important factor. I'm referring to your health. You must avoid obesity if you expect to live long. This may mean diet, exercise and boosting your metabolism. All of which can be done with the right program. 

Are you interested in boosting your metabolism right now? Hey, I will tell you that proper eating habits and good exercise will do the trick. Now, if you saw me, you would probably scowl with shear annoyance. I am 31 years old, 6'1" and 170 pounds. Clearly that's pretty good, according to my family doctor. I have 10 percent body fat. I admit that genetics do play a part. I am one of those individuals who eat regularly and drink protein shakes to keep my body weight. However, I also practice martial arts and weight train. I have been active since I was born. This had a great effect on my metabolism. It's been going and going and it's never slowed down. Although some folks say that they're annoyed with people like me, I can't help but notice that they do nothing active in their lives. This is their own fault. If you plan on getting thin and boosting your metabolism, then you have to work to get it done. Nothing is free in this world. I work out regularly; you should to.
