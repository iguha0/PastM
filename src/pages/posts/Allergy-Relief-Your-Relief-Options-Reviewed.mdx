One of the best ways to seek relief from an allergy is to stay away from or limit your exposure to the source of your problems.

Many individuals recommend pouring one cup of bowling water over oatmeal, letting it set for around thirty minutes, and then straining.  After you have made sure that the water has cooled, use a cloth or a cotton ball to apply to your hives.  For other allergy symptoms, green tea is recommended.  Green tea has natural antihistamines in it.  Other teas are also a great way to stay calm, cool, and collected.

Although there are a number of natural ways that you can manage or treat your allergy symptoms, many individuals prefer the convenience that is often associated with prescription medications and over-the-counter products.
