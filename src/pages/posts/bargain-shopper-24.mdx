Bargain Shopper

If there is one thing I am good at it is saving money. Perhaps it is the miserly influence of my dad, but I have learned to be the ultimate bargain shopper. My husband often shakes his head when he goes shopping with me, but he is always impressed in the end with the money I save, and how much I can buy for so little. When it comes to being a bargain shopper, I have learned all the tricks by experience and knowing that saving money in the store means more money in my savings. When it comes time to retire, I’ll be happy I was so picky.

One thing a good bargain shopper needs is patience. This can mean taking your time searching through a discount rack, or it can mean waiting for something expensive to come down in price or to go on sale. If you are one of those people that has to have all the newest stuff as soon as it hits the shelves, you may not be cut out to be a bargain shopper. However, if you don’t mind buying Christmas cards for the next year on December 27th, you are ready to go.

When it comes to clothing, you have to be ready to search to save some money. A bargain is not a bargain if the clothes are no good. Just because a top is six dollars at Wal-Mart does not mean that it is a good bargain. You get the bargain when you find a high priced piece of apparel marked down to an affordable price. A bargain shopper knows that when shopping for clothing, you have to take some time to search through the discount rack. A lot of the stuff won’t be anything you like, but you can find some great clothes if you look.

Remember to look at the clearance section in any store you visit, even if you aren’t looking for anything at the moment. This is a great way to get your Christmas shopping done. A good bargain shopper will start buying things early, and then will look around all year for great prices on items they know their friends and family will love. They will never know you got their gift off a clearance shelf unless you tell them. These gifts are as good as any, but you just saved yourself some money by being a good bargain shopper.
