Bumper Cars

When I first started going to amusement parks, I was not old enough to ride on the roller coasters that caught my eye, but I was allowed to get on the bumper cars that were made for kids my size. I always had a ton of fun on them, and I still look forward to riding them now when I visit an amusement park with my husband and daughter. Though these rides have been around forever, they are still by far one of the most popular rides at any park.

I have yet to let my daughter get on bumper cars because she is far too young. My husband wanted to take her on them last year, but I had visions of whiplash in my mind, and I told him we should wait a few years. She was ok with this, though my husband pouted for a little while. I told him he could go on the bumper cars by himself if he wanted to and I would go take her to find something that was more her age. He perked up after that, and I guess that showed me that even when we age we have to have fun when it is presented to us.

You can find old and new bumper cars today when you visit amusement parks and traveling fairs or carnivals. I personally love the old fashioned kind where the top of the car has a metal strip that runs across the ceiling powering each of the individual bumper cars. I actually don’t know if there is a more modern type, though it seems to me that someone told me there is. If there is, I have yet to find them yet.

If you love the bumper cars, you may be able to take a car home with you. Don’t get all excited, this is something that may happen once in a lifetime. If a small amusement park near you is going out of business, they may sell off some of the parts of their rides to make money to pay off debts. This happens most often with carousel animals, but it is not unheard of to have other parts of rides such as the bumper cars available as well. If you hear of something like this going on, make sure you jump at the chance, because it is not likely to come along again any time soon.
