Bags Under Your Eyes

I had a friend in college who always complained that she had bags under her eyes. She never knew what caused it, but it had been that way for a long time. She was a pretty girl though, and no one ever seemed to notice. It may very well just be a part of who she is and it certainly did not detract from her good looks. However, if you don’t normally have this issue, and you have bags under your eyes that seem to have come out of nowhere, there probably is a reason why this is happening.

You can get bags under your eyes from something as simple as a lack of sleep. There are many things that can happen when you don’t get enough rest, and having bags under your eyes along with a purplish hue is just one of them. You may also find that you feel weak and your mind is not as sharp as it should be. You may not recover from illness as quickly, and if this goes on long enough, you might even want to consider that you have a sleeping disorder that you should have checked out by a doctor.

I have seen a lot of remedies for when you have bags under your eyes, but I really can’t vouch for any of them personally. Luckily for me, I don’t usually have this problem, though I can’s say why because I am often stressed and I really don’t sleep well. If you have bags under your eyes from a lack of sleep, however, I have a friend who strongly stands behind using a cold eye cover for a half an hour before you get out of bed. We don’t all have time for this, of course, but it can help. There are eye masks made just for this purpose. You put them in the refrigerator or freezer for a short time and the coolness is supposed to help eliminate the purple and the bags.

If you are a woman and you have bags under your eyes that just won’t go away, you do have the option of handling the problem with make up. There are make up products out there that are designed to help with not only having bags under your eyes, but also if you have blotchy red skin for any other reason. The make up works by using light. There are colors that you can put over your skin that are the opposite of the color you are trying to cover up. I don’t know the science behind it, but you can find this stuff in your local make up aisle. From what I hear, they work really well.
