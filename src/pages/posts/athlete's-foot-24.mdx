Athlete’s Foot

Athlete’s foot is something that can happen to just about anyone. It is something that mostly happens to the feet, as you have probably guessed, but can sometimes spread to the hands or other parts of the body if given the chance. In most cases it is something that can be cleared up rather easily, but if you don’t know what it is it can be something that is very painful and can cause you to have a lot of pain when doing something as simple as walking.

You may first notice something wrong when your feet become itchy and red. Athlete’s foot has a variety of symptoms, but itchy red feet are often the first thing you notice, and this is usually around and between the toes. The skin will be sensitive and you may even notice a build up of skin where it itches the most. If you aren’t aware that you have athlete’s foot at this point, you at least know that something is very wrong. Though many catch this at a health club or swimming pool, it can come from a variety of places, many of which you would never suspect. 

One of the first things you should do if you have athlete’s foot it to go out and get an over the counter medication to help reduce your symptoms. It can help stop the itching and help to clear up the problem. You should keep your feet as dry as possible and try to go for at least a few hours a day without your shoes on. Athlete’s foot gets worse with moist warmth, so make sure you wear cotton socks to pull the moisture away from your skin and give them as much air time as possible.

If you find that your case of athlete’s foot is not clearing up with the help of an over the counter remedy, you may have to go in and see your doctor for stronger relief. If it goes on for too long, your skin can become so damaged and irritated that it splits and bleeds. If that happens you are really going to be in a lot of pain. Your doctor will know how to treat severe cases of athlete’s foot and will also be able to tell you some things you can do at home to alleviate the symptoms while you wait for the medications to work for you.
