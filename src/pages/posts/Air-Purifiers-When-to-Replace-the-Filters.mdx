Air Purifiers:  When to Replace the Filters

Are you using an air purifier to help keep the air in your home clean or to help reduce the symptoms of allergies or asthma?  If you are, does your air purifier operate with an air filter?  If does, do you know when your air filter needs to be replaced?  Unfortunately, many people do not.  Did you know, however, that a dirty air filter can impact the way that a high end home air purifier is able to do its job?  It can and that is why it is important to know when your air filters need to be replaced.

If you haven’t already bought an air purifier for your home or if you are looking to upgrade your current system, consider buying one with an automatic sensor.  This will automatically let you know when the air filter should either be replaced or cleaned.  Air filters that can be cleaned are commonly referred to as washable air filters.  Depending on the make or model, a light should turn on or an alarm-like noise will sound when the air filter needs to be replaced.

Another easy way that you can tell that your air purifier needs a replacement filter is by following the manufacturer’s guidelines.  If you are still using the original air filter, refer to your air purifier owner’s manual.  This should tell you how often the air filter should be replaced.  There are a number of benefits to this approach, as it can also help to ensure that your air is being properly cleaned, per the guidelines set by the manufacturer.  If you cannot find your owner’s manual, you may be able to find a copy online.  You can try this by performing a standard internet search with the make and model.

If you are already using a replacement air filter, refer to the information on that filter.  This information is often right on the package.  Some will list an estimated time frame in which the high end air filter in question is likely to produce the best results.  If your air filter is a different brand then the air purifier that you use, you may notice a difference from what was listed in your owner’s manual.  Many find the best results when following the directions and time frames listed on replacement air filters and their packages.

Checking the air filter is another way that you can decide if it should be cleaned or if a replacement filter is needed.  This should be easy, as most air filters are easy to find and remove, as well as put back in.  When checking an air filter, it is important to make sure that it is clean or at least semi-clean.  If there is no room for toxins and other particulates to attach to the filter, chances are a replacement is needed.

If you or someone else notices that the air quality is decreasing in your home, a high end replacement filter may be needed.  Although anyone may be able to notice a decrease in air quality, especially home occupants, those who suffer from asthma or allergies are the best at determining whether or not an air filter replacement is needed.  This is because air filters working with air purifiers to the best of their capabilities are known to reduce the symptoms and outbreaks of allergies and asthma.  When a sufferer starts displaying symptoms again, the air filter should be examined and possibly replaced.

As highlighted above, there are a number of different ways that you can go about determining if you need to change the high end air filter on your air purifier.  As a reminder, the easiest way to do so is to purchase a high end air purifier that automatically lets you know when a change as needed.  As for why air filter replacements are important, they help to keep the air truly cleaned.  If an air purifier cannot work, you are essentially losing money.
