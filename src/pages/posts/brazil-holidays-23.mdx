South America is an exciting continent to have a vacation and the most popular choice is Brazil Holidays. The biggest country in the continent contains cosmopolitan cities, golden beaches and scenic countryside. The people are friendly and the streets swing to the samba and the bossa nova bands. Many towns have colorful and spectacular carnivals. 

The food is extremely varied with regional dishes and influences from many different cultures. The national dish is black beans, pork and rice and the national drink is the Caipinnha, a concoction of limes, sugar and cachacca. Pizza houses, Lebanese, Chinese and Japanese restaurants are also popular.

One of the most popular tourist destinations is the city of Rio de Janeiro, a must see on the agenda for Brazil holidays. It is an elegant city, dominated by the world famous statue of Christ the Redeemer that overlooks the city from the top of Corcovado Hill. It is also known for staging one of the best annual carnivals and for its many beaches, Copacobana being the most famous. For the best views, an aerial tramway takes passengers to the top of Sugar Loaf Mountain, another iconic landmark.

Sao Paulo is another vibrant city, bursting with nightlife and entertainment.
