111 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR DIRECT MAIL RESPONSE

1. Mail to your customers more often. If you are now mailing 
four times a year increase the frequency of your mailings to size
or eight times. If you increase your mailings by 25% you should 
increase your sales by at least the same percentage.
2. Use a P.S. on every direct mail letter. The P.S.S is second in
importance only to the headline.
3. Don't forget to thank your customers for their orders by 
enclosing a message with the orders...and enclose another 
merchandise offer with the "thank you" message.
4. Vary your mailing format - use self-mailers, Lettergrams, 
computer letters, envelope formats, catalogs...change your format
so that prospects don't get in the habit of recognizing your 
mailing piece.

elections,, cold winters, etc.) When inflation increases, have an
"inflation-cutting" special, etc.

are.. Study the mailings firms such as the Haband Company who

letters. Occasionally test a handwritten letter...particularly if
you're soliciting funds for charity.
