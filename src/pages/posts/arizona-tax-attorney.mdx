The FAQs for the Arizona Tax Attorney

The Arizona tax attorneys are always available to answer the queries of the taxpayers who are bugged with the disputes over their annual taxes. Here are among the common questions posed by the taxpayers as they get the chance to confer with the Arizona tax attorneys.

What is common the things to happen in the event of an unfiled tax return?

Unfiled tax returns only signify one thingâ€”and that is being in real trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. If for example you owe IRS some taxes for about ten years, then they will compute it all. They will try their level best to reach you through your old address. If in this event you have moved out of the country and once you come back, IRS will go after you demanding your dues for your taxes in the entire year of your absence. 

When such case arises, you know one thing for sure. You know that you can be condemned for tax evasion. This is a crime which is punishable by the law. IRS will be very religious in sending you reminders. At one point, these reminders will become unfriendly and you will just be shocked to receive a Notice of Intent to Levy all your wages and assets.

Does it mean trouble for the unfiled tax returns that date way back?

It is in fact very much complicated if your unfiled tax returns trace to at least six years backwards. It is so because the files are kept in storage and it will need enough concerted effort to locate those records. An agent will need to browse through all of the kept files to be able to gather them all. You can just imagine how difficult it could be if your unfiled tax returns date back to some more years back in time.

What is meant by wage garnishment?

With the term wage garnishment, it means that a levy is imposed in another method. This method is concerned with the manner of collecting the back taxes which a taxpayer owes the IRS. With regards to the IRS attacks, the words levy and garnishment mean the same thing. The typical targets of the garnishment are your bank accounts and wages but the rule may also apply to the seizure of your furniture, equipment, your home, your vehicles, and your other valued possessions.

Is any bank permitted to turn over an account to IRS without the concerned party's consent?

When IRS imposes a levy on your account in the bank, your bank is legally bound to turn over whatever amount is in your existing account. It does not regard the fact as to whether it is your own money or not or where you got your money. Keeping those monies in your own account is enough justification. Most people keep direct deposits for the Social Security, pensions, child support, and many others but then the IRS does not consume time to locate the source of the money. At the time when the money gets deposited in an account which is under your name, it automatically loses its own identity.

When will these levies on the bank account be stopped?

In comparison with the wage garnishment, a levy in your bank account will only happen once. Meaning, the next batch of money that gets deposited in your account will solely be yours again.
