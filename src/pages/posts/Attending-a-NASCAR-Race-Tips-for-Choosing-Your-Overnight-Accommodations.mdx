Attending a NASCAR Race:  Tips for Choosing Your Overnight Accommodations

Are you interested in attending a live NASCAR race?  If you are, you will want to start examining all of your options as soon as possible.  While a great deal of your focus should be placed on the specific NASCAR race that you would like to attend, it is important to also examine your overnight accommodation options.

Speaking of examining your overnight accommodation options, this is exactly what you will want to do.  All NASCAR fans have a large number of options when looking to attend a long distance NASCAR race or when looking to make a fun filled weekend out of the event.  To ensure that you choose the accommodations that are best for you and your needs, you will want to examine all of your options. To help you get stared, a few of those options are highlighted below for your convenience.

Hotels are, by far, the most popular overnight accommodation for NASCAR fans who attend races.  Hotels are nice in the fact that they are relatively affordable and hassle free. Also, most NASCAR tracks have a large number of hotels located close by.  Still, with that said, you will want to make reservations quickly.  Hundreds of thousands of fans attend most NASCAR races and, as previously stated, many choose to stay at hotels.  If this is your preferred method of stay, be sure you are able to get your reservation in before all nearby hotels are filled to capacity.  

In addition to hotels, bed and breakfast inns are a great option for NASCAR fans who are looking for a hassle free stay.  They are a great option when local hotels fill up, but you will still want to make your reservations well in advance.  This is due in part to the fact that most bed and breakfast inns are relatively small in size.  Inn are a popular option for many travelers, as they always have a nice, home like look and feel to them.

RV parks are another popular overnight accommodation option for NASCAR race fans who own motor homes.  RV parks are public campgrounds that cater to motor home owners, often with larger rental spaces.  Since a large number of NASCAR fans are also motor home owners, reservations at local RV parks are likely to quickly fill up.  For that reason, and as with all other overnight accommodation options, be sure to book your reservations well in advance of your trip.  

In keeping with staying at a motor home park, many NASCAR fans believe that they cannot do so because they do not own a motor home.  Yes, RV parks are designed with motor homes in mind, but did you know that owning isn’t your only option?  It isn’t.  In the United States, there are a relatively large number of RV rental companies.  By planning ahead, you can rent an RV and turn attending a live NASCAR race into so much more, like a long distance road trip or a camping adventure.

Although RV rentals make motor homes available to many NASCAR fans, others are still concerned with the cost.  If that is the case with you, you may want to examine traditional public campgrounds.  These are campgrounds that not only accept campers in motor homes, but those using tents as well.  Most NASCAR races take place in warm weather, especially in the south.  For that reason, the weather for the NASCAR race that you would like to attend may be perfect for a camping adventure.  Generally speaking, camping is typically the most affordable overnight accommodation for NASCAR fans.

As highlighted above, you have a number of overnight accommodation options when looking to attend a NASCAR race.  As a recap, popular options include hotels, bed and breakfast inns, RV parks, and public campgrounds.  Whichever option you choose, be sure to make your reservations well in advance, as they are usually more race fans looking for accommodations than there are rooms or camping spaces to go around in the near vicinity of a racetrack.
