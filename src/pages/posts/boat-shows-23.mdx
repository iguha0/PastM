The world of boating is a fascinating one, for those in the industry and for people content to look and admire the various vessels. International boat shows are a great way to see what's on offer from the latest designs in motor boats and yachts. There are several prestigious annual events, attracting thousands of visitors. They give an opportunity to manufacturers to exhibit and for the media to report on the latest innovations, all with their own local flavor.

The Fort Lauderdale Show is a family friendly event in the Florida sunshine. It exhibits boats, yachts and accessories with a particular emphasis on superyachts. Scheduled for 25th October - 29th October 2007, the displays will be across six different locations. The local interest in fishing is reflected in the number of fishing related events. There is tuition for adults with specific sessions for ladies and children. Children in the 4-16 age range can learn to fish with Captain Don Dingman, presenter of children's TV show, Hook the Future. They also get the chance to do some face painting.

Southampton Show is the major event on the calendar of boat shows in the UK. The September 2007 event was a great success and offered a wide variety of activities and the opportunity to explore the lovely marina. One of the highlights was the appearance of the HMS Bounty, a replica pirate ship that recently featured in the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: World's End. There was a Chinese theme at the show, in honor of the coming Olympic Games in Beijing. Visitors could try out Chinese food and see fireworks displays, martial arts weapons and lion dancers. Trips on power boats and yachts were very popular as were the displays by the Coastguards and the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution). There was also tuition from scuba diving instructors.

The luxury end of the boating market is seen in the opulent splendor of Monte-Carlo at the Monaco Show. This is the only one of the boat shows to exclusively show superyachts with a minimum of 25 meters in length. Many manufacturers like to premier their latest vessels at this sparkling event. The world's most prestigious shipyards, naval architects and interior designers are represented here. The September 2007 show continued the tradition of on board cocktail parties and other social functions. Industry representatives and members of the public both enjoy all the high class amenities that the area is famous for.

The Sydney Show is another jewel in the crown of international boat shows, set in its beautiful marina and comprising a number of exciting events. The August 2007 show featured a superboat race, offshore power racing and the World Water-skiing Championship. There were workshops on boating for novices and the more advanced, which included tips on sailing through bad weather. The 2008 show has been announced for 31st July-5th August.
