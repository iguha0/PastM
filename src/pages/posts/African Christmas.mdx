12. Christmas in African Nations
	Christmas celebrations in African nations is characterized by 
much outdoor activity because the season often occurs during a time 
when the weather is pleasant. Using palm trees and participating in 
processions are also characteristic features of activities related to 
Christmas in many parts of Africa.
	In South Africa, activities that occur outside during Christmas 
include the usual caroling, but also the unusual ones of swimming and 
camping. The beach and mountains play an important role during 
Christmas in South Africa because the season occurs during the hottest 
time of the year - summer.
	Given the pleasant nature of the weather during Christmas, 
families also take advantage of it by often going sightseeing in the 
countryside on a relaxing drive in the late evening of Christmas Day. A 
rich and sumptuous menu that includes a suckling pig or roast beef, 
turkey, mince pies, yellow rice, vegetables and puddings usually makes 
up the traditional South African Christmas dinner.
	To create a festive environment, decorated pine branches and fir, 
sparkling cotton wool and tinsel are used in homes and businesses as 
decorations.
	A similar decorative pattern of using evergreen, palm trees and 
lighted candles are also seen in countries such as Ghana and Liberia. 
While these are used in homes and businesses, they are also often 
carried in processions and during caroling activities.
	While South Africans gather at the beach during Christmas time to 
enjoy the warm summer waters, people in other African nations often 
gather outside at in town squares and in the streets to march, sing and 
enjoy an overall feeling of merriment.
	Despite the seemingly general similarity in activities, however, 
countries have their own individual style that makes Christmas 
celebrations unique.
	Of all the celebrations in African nations, Christmas activities 
in Ethiopia stand out for their difference in when they are celebrated 
and how it is done. One of the features that make Ethiopian Christmas 
different is that the main celebratory event occurs	on Jan. 7, around 
the time known as the Epiphany or Three Kings Day in North and South 
America. 
	Given the general modest economic financial situations of a 
significant number of the population in many African countries, 
Christmas celebrations also tend to occur over a shorter period of 
time, compared to activities in more wealthier countries. 
	Another difference in celebrations of Christmas in Ethiopia is 
the participation of various people who take part in a pilgrimage and 
converge on the capital city during Christmas Eve. These wanderers fill 
the night air with a din of praying and chanting and create a 
multicolor spectacle when they gather on Christmas morning to have a 
religious service.
	But retaining a similarity with other African nations, Ethiopians 
enjoy a Christmas dinner that includes a meat stew. Stews, rice, root 
vegetables such as yams, breads and soups often are part of the menu of 
traditional Christmas day dinners in African nations. 
	Christmas dinners are likely enjoyed by families outside, where 
everyone shares the meal while sitting in a circular pattern outside 
under the shade of a sprawling tree, instead of sitting in a formal 
setting at a table. 
	As is the practice in every household during Christmas, Africans 
also exchange gifts. Popular items that are exchanged as Christmas 
gifts include cotton cloth, soaps, sweets, pencils and books, all very 
practical items that can be readily used. Again, this may be related to 
the modest financial resources of up to half the population in many 
African countries, as well as to cultural norms. Individuals aren't 
able to afford extravagant gifts but they still want to surprise 
children, family and friends at Christmas with an unexpected gift. The 
generally pervasive cultural norm of humility and modesty that exists 
among traditional African peoples, also plays an important role in not 
having overreaching extravagance at Christmas.
