There are other options now days for anxious couple who cannot have children. I think this is wonderful simply because I can imagine how difficult it would be to find out that you couldn't have kids. Well, not only can you adopt a child, but you can actually choose to adopt a child from another country. This is amazing! Were you aware of adoption from china? This concept is becoming more and more popular now days. Especially with female children. Now, there is a reason for this. In China, they hold the male birth to a greater importance than they do the females. Yeah, yeah, isn't this typical? Why does it always have to be the males? Can't even for once that some country does the opposite? Well, it's not likely to happen in this world. 

I first learned about adoption from china when I took a "Chinese Cinema" course in college. This would have been in 2004. My professor was a Caucasian woman, but very much into the Chinese culture. Sure, this is to be expected from someone who teaches such a subject. She has a wonderful knowledge of Chinese culture and film. The class was definitely an enlightening one to say the least. Anyway, one day she began speaking on the topic of adoption from china. I thought this was nothing out of the ordinary and assumed it was going to be related to a specific film. However, it is actually related to her own personal life. She decided a few years back to go with adoption from china. She had not yet had children of her own and she wasn't married, so she figured that she had better make a decision. Folks tend to do this after the age of 40. So she basically adopted two baby girls from China. She went on and on about how wonderful they are. She also discussed the conditions regarding reproduction in China. You cannot have more children than the government deems acceptable. Girls are basically killed off if there are too many born to a family. This is horrible. I assume this is one of the main reasons she chose adoption from china over the USA.
