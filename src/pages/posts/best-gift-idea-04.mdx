The best gift ideas are usually few and far between. Around holidays, things can get pretty stressful pretty quickly. With all of the work that goes into getting the Christmas decorations up, sending out happy holiday cards, calling up old relatives that you have not talked to in a long time, and all the rest of it, usually picking out Christmas presents is a rushed and frantic affair. You want to pick out the best gift idea for the people you love, but when you feel rushed and frantic, sometimes it is all just too much. 

With a little creativity, however, you can really find great Christmas presents at the last minute. The key is to think outside the box. My best friend, for example, is a real humanitarian. He volunteers at a couple of charities and always gives money to help the homeless or the environment. That is how,  last year, I discovered the perfect best friends Christmas gift idea. I got him a charitable contribution for one of his favorite charities, save the children. I was a little bit unsure, but it turned out to go over very well. He liked knowing that his Christmas gift was making a difference in the life of someone less fortunate than him.

Of course, this would not be the best gift idea for everyone. If I got something like that for my girlfriend, she would be quite unhappy. The best Christmas gifts for people close to you are ones that reflect on the nature of your relationship. For a girlfriend, a watch, bracelet, necklace, or pair of earrings is almost always a perfect present. Girls love stuff like that, and by giving them those kinds of gifts, you let them know that you think they are pretty.

Sometimes, the best gift idea is something wholly unexpected. I have a friend who I have been in contact with on and off since I was five or six. When I got him a new GI Joe action figure set, he positively flipped. You see, we used to love to play with that kind of action figure when we were kids. We hadn’t talked about it in years, so getting it out of the blue was a delightful surprise for my old and dear friend. I can’t say that this kind of approach will always work for picking out a present, but if your friend can take a joke and loves surprises, it might just be the best gift idea.
