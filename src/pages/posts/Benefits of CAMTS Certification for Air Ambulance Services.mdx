Benefits of CAMTS Certification for Air Ambulance Services

As you shop around for an air ambulance service, you may be confused about all the details.  How do you know which air ambulance service is best?  If you are looking for air ambulance transportation that is high-quality and lives up to standards, then look for a service that is CAMTS certified.

What does CAMTS mean?  The initials CAMTS stand for Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services.  Companies who are accredited by CAMTS receive several benefits.  Although the company must incur some cost and time commitment for the certification, the company who receives such an honor will appreciate the time and money invested.  

The air ambulance service that is certified by CAMTS may have lowered insurance premiums due to the quality commitment and high safety standards.  Local, state, and federal government may recognize the CAMTS certified air ambulance company.  Such certified air ambulance services may be granted contracts only available to certified companies.  The credibility attained by CAMTS certification is prestigious among other medical transport companies and the public.  

Customers will note the CAMTS certification and know that they are securing a flight with a dependable air ambulance service.  The commitment to excellence seen only by CAMTS certified companies will provide confidence to the customer.  During stressful times, it can be hard to know that you are making the right decision about medical issues, but choosing a CAMTS certified air ambulance will make the decision easier.

Because no federal or state regulations exist to standardize many of the practices associated with air ambulance transport, it is difficult to determine which companies are best and which companies simply will do the job.  CAMTS certified companies are required to meet minimum standards that indicate the company is providing excellent service that focuses on patient comfort and safety.  

The company interested in certification begins by critically assessing their own organization.  This helps the air ambulance service note their strengths and weaknesses.  In time, inspectors come to the site of the service to assess the company and their practices.  With this amount of scrutiny, it is no doubt that the company has the opportunity to perfect any problems.  

Measurements are taken in regards to communication, administration, education, and maintenance.  If the air ambulance company fails to meet the minimum requirements, they will not receive the CAMTS certification.  While companies who do not have the certification may, in fact, meet the standards, there is no way to judge this fact.  Customers selecting only CAMTS certified air ambulance services can be certain that such minimum standards are met.  Periodically, certified companies are re-evaluated to ensure quality.

Certification from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services offers several benefits for the air ambulance service.  Among prestige and lower insurance premiums, the company will get more business.  Customers in search of a high-quality air ambulance service will be able to easily separate the CAMTS certified companies from the rest of the pack.  CAMTS certification is a win-win situation for both air ambulance companies and potential customers of the service.
