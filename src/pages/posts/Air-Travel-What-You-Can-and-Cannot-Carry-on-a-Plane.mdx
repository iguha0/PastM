Air Travel:  What You Can and Cannot Carry-on a Plane

Are you the process of packing for an upcoming trip that you have scheduled?  If you are, does your trip call for air travel?  If it does, you may first want to take the time to familiarize yourself with TSA’s rules and restrictions, concerning prohibited items.  There are a number of benefits to doing so.

As previously stated, there are a number of benefits to familiarizing yourself with what items are allowed aboard an airplane or allowed in carry-on bags before you start packing for your trip.  One of those benefits is that you will be able to pass through airport security with ease.  This, alone, has a number of benefits, such as not missing a flight, no embarrassment, and no hassle to deal with.

When it come to familiarizing yourself with the items that are allowed aboard an airplane, namely in carry-on bags, you have a number of options.  Most airports will clearly outline what is allowed and isn’t allowed; however, you shouldn’t wait until the last minute to familiarize yourself with these rules.  Instead, you will want to visit the online website for the TSA.  This website can easily be found with a standard internet search.  A few of the rules and restrictions that you may find, concerning prohibited items, are outlined below for your convenience.

One concern that many individuals have is with sharp objects.  Generally, sharp object that can be used as a weapon are prohibited from being carried on a plane.  With that said, you will find exceptions to this rule.  For example, cuticle cutters, cigar cutters, kitting needles, and crochet needles are allowed.  Scissors are also permitted in carry-on bags, as long as they are less than four inches long and have blunt ends.

In keeping with sharp objects, disposable razors are allowed in carry-on bags, but many other sharp objects aren’t.  For example, box cutters, loose razor blades, and swords are not allowed in carry-on bags.  As for knifes, they are prohibited, unless the knives in question are plastic or non-sharp butter knifes.

Generally speaking, no sporting equipment is allowed to be carried on a plane, in carry-on bags.  This is because many pieces of sporting equipment can be used as a weapon, especially when in the wrong hands.  The TSA prohibits the carrying of baseball bats, ski poles, pole cubes, and hockey sticks.  If you must bring these items with you, they must be checked in an appropriate sized case or bag.

As for children’s toys, you will find that most items are allowed.  However, there is some concern with certain toys.  The TSA allows the carrying on of transformer robots as well as toy weapons.  With said, toy weapons are only allowed in carry-on bags if they do no look too realistic.  If you are a parent, it may be best to use your best judgment and leave all toy weapons at home, as there are many more things for your child to do on an airplane.

As for walking canes, as well as other medical equipment, like wheel chairs, they are allowed.  However, there may be some extra rules and restrictions, as well as steps taken.  For example, airport security may thoroughly check a walking cane, especially one that has two detachable parts.  This is done to ensure that no weapons or dangerous objects are concealed.

As for electronics, you will find that almost all are allowed aboard an airplane in carry-on bags.  These items include camcorders, laptop computers, cell phones, pagers, and PDA systems.  In fact, airports often recommend keeping these items in carry-on bags, as storing them in checked baggage is often risky, in terms of damage.

The above mentioned rules and restrictions, concerning items prohibited aboard an airplane in carry-on bags, are just a few of the many rules that apply.  As a reminder, you should take the time to familiarize yourself with all airport rules and restrictions before you starting packing for your trip.
