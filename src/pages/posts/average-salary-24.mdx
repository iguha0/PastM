average salary

When it was time to graduate from college, my classmates and I had a class that helped us put together our resume and to learn how to interview and plan for the future of our careers. What I learned was helpful, but I do wish I had learned more. It might seem easy enough to go on an interview and land a job, but there is more to it than that. Most jobs that require professional training have an average salary. This is information that is important to know, but this was not something that we learned.

When you start out, you may think the average salary for a starting position would be minimum wage, but that is not true in most professions. This means you may be making less in your first job than you should be. Most companies will not tell you that you are not asking for or making what you should be. Though it is never a good idea to talk about salary with coworkers, this is how most realize they are not getting what everyone else is getting, and it is often their own fault. They may not have known that some salary is negotiable, or that they can ask for more than offered.

If you don’t know what the average salary for your position might be, you should look it up. Though it might seem easy to talk to those you work with, it is not something that you should do. Discussing salary between coworkers is a recipe for disaster. Instead, look online to see what others in your position are making, and look for numbers in regards to how much experience you have, where you live, and what type of degree you have earned. Those variables all make a difference in the average salary that you can expect.

Once you have gained experience, you should naturally assume that your average salary can go up. If you are good at your job, show up on time and don’t take excessive days off, you may be in line for some more money. You may also decide to look elsewhere if your company will not pay the average salary that you are expecting. It is important to earn what you are worth, and though most companies will be glad to pay you for your skill, they don’t always offer it to you unless you ask for it. It can be hard to ask for a raise, but when you are worth more, that is what you should be making. If they refuse, you can always look elsewhere.
