Air Ambulance Service Coverage a Great Benefit for Employees

Big business today knows the value of a good employee.  Good employees are getting harder and harder to find these days.  Excellent workers are not only interested in great pay, but also in a fabulous benefits package.  If you are looking for another terrific perk to add to the company's benefits package, it may be time to consider air ambulance service coverage.

Companies can receive excellent discounts on air ambulance service coverage costs for groups of employees.  The cost can be covered exclusively by the employer, or paid partially by the employer and shared with the employee.  

Air ambulance service coverage plans are not only affordable, but a fabulous benefit for business travelers.  Most coverage plans require that the plan only be utilized when the patient is 150 miles away from home.  If the company has numerous employees that travel from state to state or around the globe on business, then this just may be a benefit that should be added to the company's roster.

A medical emergency can't be planned.  No one heads off on a business trip and expects to become ill or injured, but in reality, this may be the case.  Should such a circumstance arise while an employee is away on business, it is important that they be able to return home as quickly as possible.

The cost of transportation by air ambulance can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $75,000 per trip.  Air ambulance service coverage can be used anywhere around the globe.  For a minimal annual or monthly fee, the air ambulance transportation cost can be minimized dramatically, or even reduced completely.

Employees will find this benefit to be a great offering from the company.  Business travelers will want to protect themselves, their family, and their wallet while they are away on business and air ambulance service coverage is just the way to do it.  

As you shop for coverage plans for your employees, be certain to compare prices closely.  Read the fine-print on the plan and be cautious of several exclusions of coverage.  

Some key issues to consider before signing up include the specific details of the coverage plan.  For the best coverage, make sure that the air ambulance will arrive for pickup of the patient regardless of medical need.  This will ensure that employees are transported safely back home to family and the hospital in the health insurance plan network.  

The patient should be able to determine the final hospital destination.  Employees who have a preference of a local hospital will truly appreciate this option.  

Lastly, confirm that the air ambulance service coverage is not only nationwide, but global coverage.  Making this determination will broaden the spectrum of opportunity for this valuable benefit.  For companies with overseas travelers, this benefit will be extremely popular with the employees.

You know that securing excellent staff is essential to the well-being of the business.  Salary and benefits packages are what bring the superior employees to you.  Air ambulance service coverage is just one more fabulous benefit that your company can offer to your employees at a reasonable cost.  Employees will value the benefit's protection to their family and their wallet.  Companies that offer security to their employees have loyal workers for years to come.
