There is a lot to think about when planning a wedding. If you are the bride, you have so much on your mind that something is bound to be forgotten. That is when wedding planner books, or even hiring wedding planners might be a good idea. I found that despite my good planning and my book, I was still forgetting some small things that would have ended up being very big problems on my wedding day. I completely forgot about bridal purses, and had it not been for my maid of honor, I may have forgotten completely. I would have been sorry.

Your wedding day is not a day when you want to carry around your regular purse. You spend a lot of time making sure your dress, shoes, hair, accessories, and even your stockings are just right. That look is ruined unless you have bridal purses that match. I havenâ€™t met a woman yet that did not need some sort of purse with her on her wedding day. If you forget to look at bridal purses, you may find you are suddenly all out of whack when you should be feeling put together and calm.

My maid of honor had called me about two weeks before my wedding asking me about a few things. One of those things was bridal purses. To my horror, I realized that I had not thought about it and I had no idea if I had time to go out and find one. I had too much to do, and was working on top of that. She told me not to worry, and asked me to take a picture of my dress and email it to her so she could find something for me. She lived a number of hours away, so a photo of the dress would have had to do.

I had quite a few bags of my own, but none of them were anything near what bridal purses should be. I did not own anything in white, let alone the off white that was my dress. When she came up for my wedding, she handed me a purse that was absolutely perfect, and even matched my dress. Thank goodness for her and her good thinking! I never thought about bridal purses, but by midday it became very apparent that I needed one, and after all these years, I still thank her for thinking of it, and taking care of the problem for me.
