Disable Your Computer's Parasites

An individual who uses a computer with an Internet connection pretty much practices caution when downloading programs from the Internet and email because of the threat of viruses and worms. These malicious program codes and programs can cause your system to become unstable and worse yet, after it has spread within your system, it further infects other systems connected to yours.

This is why any sensible computer user has anti virus programs installed in one's computer for protection against attacks from viruses and worms that proliferate the Internet. The good thing about viruses and worms is the fact that it is easier to spot them trying to get into your system. For instance, a virus or worm can try to enter your system through a suspicious attachment usually from an unknown source. By now, most Internet users know better than to open suspicious attachments. Also, rigorous anti virus programs can scan attachments before you can open them so that your risk against viruses and worms are properly managed.

However, as an Internet user, you have more to worry about than viruses and worms. Unfortunately, anti virus programs are not designed to detect other types of threats and if you are not careful, you may unwittingly install adware and spyware into your system and once this happens, uninstalling these programs can become problematic. For one thing, most spyware can go undetected in your system. You will continue on your regular computer and Internet habits without realizing that your privacy is immensely violated and your security is greatly hindered.

Since spyware can go undetected and you can continue to use your computer and the Internet as usual, there is no need to worry about uninstalling spyware, right? 
Wrong.

Spyware in mild cases infringes on your privacy because it can track and take note of your usage patterns and these information are reported back to the company that created the spyware so that they can build marketing profiles. More than that though, some spyware have the ability to register and take note of key strokes, scan documents within your computer's hard drive, and can steal your passwords and other sensitive information that can make you the victim of identity theft and other situations where your personal information can be used to compromise your security.

On the other hand, adware is used by companies to infect your computer with unsolicited ads. The most problematic kinds are the ones that indiscriminately pop ads on to your screen even if you are not viewing their site or using the parent program that launched the adware. In fact, in some cases, adware continues to work into your system long after you uninstalled the program it came bundled with.

Given the security risks, the invasion of your right to privacy, and the annoying effects of spyware and adware, you will be wise to uninstall these programs from your computer. However, to uninstall adware and spyware from your system is not such a simply task.

For one thing, companies that proliferate the Internet with spyware and adware go to great lengths to ensure that uninstalling them from your system can be difficult. For instance, in most cases, you will be unable to use legitimate software if you attempt to uninstall the adware or spyware it comes bundled with. Adware and spyware are usually bundled with legitimate freeware or shareware and cannot run independently of each other.
