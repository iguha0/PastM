Bath Safety

Bathing is an essential part of life. We start our lives bathing in the bathtub, and we usually revert to the bathtub in your latter years, even if we have been partial to showers for most of our adult lives. When it comes to taking a bath, both for children and the elderly, you have to think of bath safety to make sure that no one gets hurt or even killed while in the tub. While I’m sure bathtub deaths are rare, they can still happen if parents or caretakers don’t know about bath safety and what they should do to keep everyone from having an accident.

When you leave the hospital you may be given some instructions for bath safety from the doctor or nurse, or you may be on your own. When bathing an infant or young child, you have to be concerned with quite a few different aspects of bath safety. You have to make sure the water is never hot enough to burn your child’s skin, and you have to make sure they are never left alone. Children left alone in the tub can put their face in the water and drown. It is also essential that when a child begins to bathe in an adult sized tub that there is a bath mat or nonskid strips on the bottom of the tub.

If you are elderly, or caring for someone else, you have to also worry about bath safety. You have to take the same considerations you should take with an infant. While the elderly are certainly not going to put their face in the water, they may rely on you to make sure the water is not too hot, and they may need rails to get in and out of the tub safely. They also need a skid resistant surface at the bottom of the tub, and they may need extra help getting in and out of the tub. They already know about bath safety, but they may need you to assist them.

If you need items for bath safety, they are as close as your local store. You can look in home stores, home improvement stores, or in the bath and kitchen section of your favorite department store. Where you shop will depend on what you need. If you aren’t sure what is best, and which bath safety items you need, ask a salesperson to assist you. They should know what items you might need, and which ones you can do without.
