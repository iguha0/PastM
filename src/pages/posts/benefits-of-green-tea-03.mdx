These days we have a plethora of supplements and health products to choose from. I can't fathom why anyone wouldn't take advantage of all these. I certainly do. I started taking a daily multivitamin 12 years ago. Wow, I must be getting old. On top of that, I embrace the benefits of whey protein and Omega 3 supplements. Both of which highly benefit your body. Granted you probably won't consider these nutritional wonders when you're still a child, but you should start giving them some thought as an adult. After all, so much changes with our bodies as we age. I can still recall back when I visited Taiwan. This culture was very much into the benefits of green tea. Actually they supposedly produced the best tea on the planet there. Natives informed me of this several times. It seemed like they were proud of it. 

I doubt that many Americans understand the tea routine. When I was staying with my buddy's family for a couple months, his uncle enlightened me to the benefits of green tea. He said that they took a good 45 minutes out of each day to just sit down and enjoy tea. Now, I soon found this out. As I entered the tea room, I was a little in awe. Wow, they take the benefits of green tea very seriously. I couldn't believe that the finest room in the house was for tea drinking ceremonies. However, it was really cool at the same time. We sat and drank tea out of very small cups. As my buddy's uncle continued to make it, I would just keep on drinking it. Man was I feeling the benefits of green tea. Okay, I really just had to pee badly. Nevertheless I held it as long as I could. Until the tea ceremony was completely finished. I must have used the bathroom about four times after that. It was time to ask this fine fellow what the benefits of green tea are. He smiled and informed me that the tea cleanses your body. It helps your kidneys and bladder by removing harmful toxins. Overall the benefits of green tea are well worth a few cups. 

If you are considering tea drinking for health, then I suggest you dig a bit deeper. Find out what the best teas are and where they come from. Chances are it's Taiwan. Also, compare opinions, issues and costs. It pays to do a little research.
