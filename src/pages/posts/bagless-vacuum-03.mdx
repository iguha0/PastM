I'll bet it has happened to you. It's actually happened to me three times now. You're lounging and relaxing in your home or just sitting down to dinner when the doorbell rings. Naturally you proceed to answer it. After all, it's probably a package or something. But, when you jerk open that door, there he stands. That annoying vacuum cleaner salesman. He probably has some kind of cleaner in his hand or something rather. He offers to do a demonstration on your carpet or clean your living room. If I were you, I wouldn't let him in. Not unless you want to pay between 2 and 3 grand for a bagless vacuum cleaner. I definitely didn't. But, like most folks I entertained his sales pitch. One that he claimed would take all of 40 minutes, but actually took 3 hours, literally. What a mistake. 

Maybe you've noticed that bagless vacuum cleaners are all the rage now days. With these you often get to see what you're vacuuming up and you don't have to bother with those nasty bags. Most people love the idea of these features. However, there are reasonable bagless vacuum cleaners and there are ridiculously priced bagless vacuum cleaners. The Kirby line is absurd if you ask me. My mother-in-law purchased one years ago and it broke. There's no way I'm paying 2500 dollars for a vacuum cleaner that's going to bust in the future. That baby better last a lifetime. Personally I went with the Dyson Animal. Surely you've seen plenty of these on TV ads. I've had mine for over a year now, and I certainly don't have any complaints. It pulls up loose dirt, dust and hair from the carpets and floors with ease and you can always see everything you vacuum up. It's funny how quickly the tank fills up, but to me that just means that the bagless vacuum cleaner is doing its job. 

In comparison to past vacuum cleaners I've used, I have to say that the Dyson bagless vacuum cleaner is the best so far. I like the way it's lightweight and easy to manage. Emptying the dirt container is also a breeze. It simply pops of and drops the contents in the trash can at the press of a button. Furthermore, these vacuum cleaners have several attachments you can acquire, depending on what you need to clean.
