7 Ways For An Easy & Hassle-Free Meeting Planning

When it comes to meetings, you have to come fully prepared and ready to state your side and then show all the documentation that you have used and collected. There are basically seven ways for you to have an easy and hassle free meeting plan.

The first thing that you must do is think about everything that you will need. Make sure that if you need an overhead projector that it is set up in the room before the meeting starts. You may want to come to the meeting an hour or two head and set the room. You need to make sure that all the equipment that you use is good and works. This is the time for you to set up the rest of the room. You may need to rearrange the furniture and other things to make sure that everyone can comfortably see the presentation. You may also want to take this time to set your table up. If you have folders or handouts that you would like to share with your associates, you may want to leave them at the end of the table or around the table. 

Before you go to set up the meeting room, you should have an agenda. If it is your meeting and you are in charge, make sure that you have an agenda so that everyone knows exactly what the meeting is about. You can send them in emails or by fax so that everyone knows exactly what to come prepared for. This will make your meeting go smoothly because all the facts and documents that the group will need will be present. Since everyone will be aware of what the discussion is about they will come prepared with all their notes and facts. 

If you are conducting the meeting, you will need a speech. You don't have to write a complete speech, but take note cards to remind you of the key points. This way you don't overlook a vital piece of your presentation. You can keep your note cards in your hands during the meeting, or you can leave them on the podium for reference. 
 
If you aren't sure how long the meeting is going to be, you may want to cancel all your other meetings and dates for the rest of the day. This way you don't feel like you have to rush the presentation or meeting. Also, the other people whom you had set a schedule with will also appreciate the gesture.   

When you go to set up the meeting, you should go through a practice run. This way you can calm your nerves and deliver a great speech. Also, you will know exactly what your speech will take time wise, so you can have a guess to how long the meeting will be. Then you can call your secretary and cancel any meetings that you may need to 

Finally, the last tip that you should follow when it comes to giving a hassle free meeting is to talk to your secretary and ask them to hold any unimportant calls. However, you should talk to them what an emergency is. Unless it pertains to your family, then you should never accept any calls during the meeting. If you do decide to take a call, then you should leave the room and ask someone else to take over for a minute or ask the group to think about your presentation so far and you'll come back to clear any misunderstands once you've taken the call.

All these tips should help you have a smooth meeting and come to the meeting well prepared. When you go to a meeting prepared, the meeting will go as good as possible for you and your team or company.
