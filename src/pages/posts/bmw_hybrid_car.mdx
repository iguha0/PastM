BMW Hybrid Car: German Engineering Brilliance and Elegance fitted with Revolutionary Hybrid Technology, A combination of Style and Performance


Joining the number of Car manufacturers that have been concerned for the growing demand for environment friendly cars, German car manufacturing giant BMW has announced that they too would soon be producing and selling Hybrid cars. Within the next four years, BMW will be providing its own version of the phenomenal and popular hybrid car.

Knowing the many innovations and excellent qualities BMW has contributed to the motor world, we can be sure that this would be another automotive engineering breakthrough that would set the par others would follow. 

BMW said that their Hybrid car would run on both Hydrogen and petroleum and this would be first infused in the 7 series BMW. Already, BMW has some of these cars test driven in different countries. Researchers and engineers are already staging some tests and are getting feedbacks to perfect their first hybrid car release. BMW doesn’t want to release just a beautiful looking car, they want one that will be truly environment friendly as well as performing beautifully.

Deviating from the usual fuel cells used by other hybrid car manufacturers, BMW decided on using hydrogen-fuel combined with an internal combustion engine. This led to more research and development needed because of the demand of the engine to keep the hydrogen in liquid form, and this poses as a problem in keeping them cold enough to do just that. If the engine becomes too hot, the hydrogen may evaporate requiring frequent fill ups. Another quandary is keeping the hydrogen from evaporating while in transit to the engine. But BMW has said that it has found the solution to this problem. 

BMW sees hydrogen as the solution, but it would take about two more decades before a car can actually be run by hydrogen only. But they are positive that this is very achievable. 

BMW claims that for the past thirty years, they have been developing technology that could just lead to the first ever pure hydrogen vehicle. They already have a car that is being powered by water, a car that emits water vapor at the tailpipe, and are to retrieve hydrogen from sunlight.

BMW has been focusing on Hydrogen as a great power source for cars because it is the best solution to the ever-worsening emissions from vehicles that contributes to environmental pollution. This is because hydrogen doesn’t have dangerous emissions, it poses no harm to the atmosphere, it doesn’t deplete natural resources, as it can be take from numerous recyclable sources. This is BMW's solution, powering vehicles with hydrogen produced from water through the use of solar energy. This advancement in technology is evident with the BMW 750hl production car showcased at the Expo 2000. Together with some of its partners, BMW may be behind in the mass production of Hybrid cars, but they are the forefront in Hybrid technology. 

Soon enough, we will all be the beneficiaries of all of these developments and innovations. Not only will we able to save up on gas money, we will also be saving the environment. Owning a Hybrid car doesn’t have to mean riding in cramped cars with low engine power. With the unveiling of the BMW hybrid car in the near future, you get sophistication, power, elegance and style while helping clean up our air.
