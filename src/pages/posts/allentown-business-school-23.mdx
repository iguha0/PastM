Higher education institutions with good reputations are highly prized. One such establishment is Lehigh Valley College, still known by its previous, familiar name of Allentown Business School. Founded in 1869, the college has expanded its curriculum and campus over the years, re-locating on four occasions. Its original name came from its proximity to Allentown in Pennsylvania and its final move in 2003 brought it to Center Valley, 55 miles from Philadelphia.

The purpose of the school is to award Associate Degrees in the area of vocational subjects. Accreditation is granted by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. Students can gain these degrees at Allentown Business School in an 18 month period. There are day, evening and Saturday lessons, enabling students with a full time job to study. Financial aid and housing assistance is offered for eligible candidates. 

Each student can benefit from one to one tuition and from the excellent facilities at the school. The campus spreads across 30 acres, containing 40 classrooms, a library, 5 PC laboratories, 4 Mac laboratories and 2 art studios. After completion of a degree, students at Allentown Business School are given guidance from the school's Careers Service on how to compile a resume, how to conduct themselves in a job interview and how to set about finding employment in their chosen field.

There are several subject areas to choose from, each with a specific job in mind on qualifying. One of the most popular courses is the Business Administration with Concentration in Fashion Merchandising Program. This degree is designed as a route into a career as an assistant buyer or fashion consultant. The Criminal Justice Program course could lead to a job in security or as a private detective. Other courses include the Health Information Technology Program, the Massage Therapy Program and the Medical Assisting Program.

When considering entering Allentown Business School, candidates are invited for a personal interview and a full tour of the campus. Advice is given on the most suitable course for each potential student and parents or partners are welcome to accompany the candidate. It is possible to make an application online.

A credit transfer scheme is in place with Rosemont College, a women's Catholic college in Rosemont, Penn. The arrangement works very well for students who want to transfer there on Criminal Justice, Management and Business Communications degrees. The program at Rosemont is an accelerated one, leading to a bachelor degree.
