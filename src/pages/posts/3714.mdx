HOW TO GET FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OVER 60 MAGAZINES

To receive your choice of these magazines, TYPE your request on
your letterhead or a plain sheet of paper. Ask to be placed on
their mailing list to receive future copies. Some of the
magazines may arrive for only a few months of the year. In these
cases, simply mail another request for the magazine to continue
your subscription indefinitely. I have been receiving some of
these magazines for almost 10 years by re-submitting my request
every 6 to 12 months.
