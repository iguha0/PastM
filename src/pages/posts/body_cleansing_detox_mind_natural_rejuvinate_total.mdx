All natural body detox for body cleansing and total mind rejuvenation


When we hear the word toxin, we mistakenly think of poison in a labeled bottled. Indeed, toxins are poisonous, but they are not necessarily labeled when they enter our body in many and perhaps unthinkable ways. Imagine how minute and invisible microbes are and that they can penetrate into our pores. And everyday exposure to street life allows you to meet all sorts of air pollution. If germs can enter your body through very small openings, how much more to total exposure where viruses can easily enter? 

So what happens when the body is overloaded with pollutants? Well, it’s not as simple as just getting sick. Mind processing is significantly affected and all the rest of your body. Pollutants block or slow down the delivery of needed nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body. And since the brain is the major consumer of oxygen, it has the tendency to be damaged. Have you noticed that after doing a hard-hitting mental work, you feel very exhausted even when you were just seated for hours? It is because the brain can sometimes override the whole body. So when there are lots of toxins in you, your mind becomes sluggish too. 

And most of the time, it’s tough to protect ourselves to the extent of being disease-proof. Although the body provides its own system of healing, we need to take care of it and help it function better. That is why we need to detoxify. Detoxification helps in rejuvenation of the mind as much as it cleanses the body.

The safest way to detoxify is having it the natural way - through proper diet. In this process of cleansing, you reduce your intake of junk. This means that you must avoid products that obstruct your filtering system. These products are fats, alcohol, caffeine, and food additives. While you stay away from these foods, you replace them with easy to digest fruits and vegetables. They are not only rich in vitamins, but they supplement the body with energy boosting nutrients. Surely, they are clean, given that they are prepared freshly and cleanly. The fibers in fruits and vegetables toss the toxins out.

In detoxification, fasting for a short period of time will catalyze the process. Of course this should be done under the supervision of your nutritionist or doctor. During the process, solid foods are avoided. Your intake is solely made of fruit juice and herbal teas. Researches are made to prove that fasting decreases the stress on the digestive system. By emptying the stomach, toxins are also flushed out of the body. And the liquids that you take keep you away from starving. Nevertheless, fasting is quite critical so it is advised that a physician must be consulted first. Preferably, fast during the weekends when your time is allotted merely to relaxation.

In addition to fruit juices, some supplements are recommended for safety. To name a few are the fermented soybeans and algae powder. Fermented soy beans support the colon function and help produce the good intestinal bacteria which are major proponents of the inner cleansing process. In parallel, the algae powder gives you the feeling of being full. It supplies ample protein to ease the fatigue that some people experience during fasting.

Detoxification in the whole is a matter of a good system of living.
