bath and body

If you want to get my attention, you should offer me a new type of bath and body products. I don’t know what it is about them, but I love things that leave me feeling pampered and smelling great. Many women love these things, but for some reason I seem to go out of my way to collect more than I could possibly use. Perhaps this is why that business is so big. I am sure that I am not the only one that does this.

Not only do I like to get bath and body things for myself, I love to give these things out as gifts for holidays and birthdays. I recently gave my mother in law a basket full of great bath and body salts and soaps meant for the bath. She is caring for her dying mother, and taking her husband for cancer treatments, so I wanted to give her something that might help her relax in the event she finds some time for herself. Because she needs to relax, I choose lavender, which is know to be a great scent to calm the nerves.

Another of my favorite bath and body scents is jasmine. I had never used it until recently, and now I wish I had known about it sooner. I was given a set of bath and body products by my dad in this scent. He knows that I love the lotions and soaps, but he never remembers my favorites. He took a chance and bought me the jasmine scent, and I am so glad that he did. It reminds me a bit of lilac, which is also one of my favorites. I used the scent on vacation recently and fell in love with it. I will be sure to buy it again in the future.

If you know someone who loves bath and body items as much as I do, don’t be afraid to get them these things whenever you feel the need to buy them a gift. It is smart to know what scents they like, or what types of bath and body products that they like to use the most, but they will always appreciate getting more. If you aren’t sure what to buy, a gift certificate can also be an excellent choice. You can find these things almost anywhere you shop, and you can find a great selection online as well. Don’t forget that there are some that are completely natural, so you don’t have to worry about chemicals if that is something you shy away from for health reasons.
