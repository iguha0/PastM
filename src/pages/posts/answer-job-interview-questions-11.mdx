Answer Job Interview Questions

Most of us have some level of anxiety walking into an interview; it can be extremely overwhelming and difficult to concentrate. When you interview for a job, you want to put your best foot forward and demonstrate that you are the right person for the job. By familiarizing yourself with how to answer job interview questions ahead of time, your chances of securing the job increase significantly. Interviewers are adept at asking job interview questions and your success depends primarily on how you answer these pertinent questions. Some may appear overly direct, but the intention is always the same; the interviewer(s) simply want to find out if you're really the best candidate for the job. Familiarity with the company and the types of questions the interviewer will ask will greatly enhance your career, no matter how experienced and skilled you are.

You can find some great resources on how to answer job interview questions from numerous online employment resources. Find out the top five most asked job interview questions and how to answer them confidently from sites like www.workbloom.com and many others. The most common opening question is usually “tell me about yourself”, which is your opportunity to positively introduce yourself and your employment history, highlighting your unique qualifications, primary strengths, achievements, and other positive contributions you can bring to the job and the company. It is definitely to your benefit to know as much as possible about the company you're applying to work at, be confident, and expect to answer job interview questions like, “what are your weaknesses?” or "what did you hate most about your last job?" Instead of digging yourself a hole, highlight a trait the interviewer will perceive as strength, such as your superb attention to detail and how you expect the same from your colleagues. 

Aside from your resume, a job interview is the only thing standing between you and your dream job. Make sure you dress well; no t-shirt and jeans or revealing party-wear. Smile and project a positive enthusiastic attitude, and remember your manners and communicate clearly and audibly. Bring a fresh copy of your resume and cover letter too, even if they already have one. Afterward, send a thank you email later that day, and don't wait until the next day or the day after. If you haven't heard anything in a week, give the hiring manager a call to ask if they are close to making a decision, or if they already have. Taking on new challenges and greater responsibility should be emphasized when you answer job interview questions, because going without aspirations or career goals makes you appear unmotivated. Act like you really want the job and you’ll probably get it; attitude is everything!
