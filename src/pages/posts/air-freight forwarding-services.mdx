The Success of the Air Freight Forwarding Industry


The Birth... 

Even before, flying has been an innovation. Humans before couldn’t imagine of a time without journey. All they wanted was to fly. That’s why airplanes were born.  Eventually, technology made it a reality for people to ride on the airplane near the pilot. People became restless that they started thinking of some beneficial ways where they can use the plane.

 It was on the year 1910 when the idea that a plane can be used to carry shipments began. History revealed that a bolt of silk was the first to be shipped in a plane. The shipment was carried from Dayton to Columbus in Ohio. This was said to be the first demonstration of the air freight.

In 1919, another shipment took place. A converted bomber was shipped by the American Railway Express. The cargo was 1100 pounds, and was transported from Washington D.C to Chicago. Unluckily, the plane and the radiator froze had to land in Ohio. However, that didn’t hinder the people from using the plane as freight carrier.

During the late 1920s, more airlines operated as freight carrier.  The creation of the freight carrier was used for American business only. The air freight had helped them not only in making the transportation of merchandise rapidly but also the fast pace of the process.  

Undeniably, the primitive stages of the air freight business made a remarkable growth.

By the year 1927 to 1931 the number and size of the shipments had increased from 45,000 pounds to almost a million pounds. Though there were some effort at planning and organizing the air freight business, the commercial air freight did not operate until World War II ended.

The top 4 known airlines namely: American, United, TWA and Eastern formed the Air Cargo Inc. The primary mission of the company was to pick up and deliver cargo.  

The Air Cargo was active until the end of the world. But in 1944, United and TWA began to be independent and had their own air freight business.

 There were lots of small plane owners who wanted to part of the air cargo industry but were not accepted. The big airlines didn’t like smaller airlines to operate in the business. One reason for that was the possibility that the small airlines might screw up the constant status of the industry. Another reason was the former didn’t want to be involved in a competition.

Unluckily, those small plane operators who tried fell by the pavement.  There’s only one that survived- it’s called the “Flying Tigers”. The Flying Tigers made it because it carried both military and civilian freight. And it was also known before as the largest in air freight liner industry.

In spite of the good start, the air freight business wasn’t developing that much. It didn’t work well in the business. Until someone in the name of Fred Smith opened up his new air freight known today as the Federal Express.
