The holiday season is a time for children and it's especially exciting for families who are celebrating baby's first Christmas. There are traditional and not so traditional presents available for the youngest member of the household. Many of these baby Christmas gift items will be treasured for years to come. Of course, babies have been known to be more fascinated by the wrapping paper!

Simple toys are always appreciated, such as ring games, building blocks, bath toys or rattles. Sqeezy balls or anything that whistles, rings a bell or otherwise makes a noise will keep baby entertained whilst Mom and Dad cook the Christmas dinner.  After an exciting day, it may take baby a while to settle down and go to sleep. A mobile above the cot might do the trick, especially one that plays a soothing lullaby. A music box is another musical idea.

Some items can be personalized with a message or the baby's name. There are My First Christmas Baby Blankets available in addition to teddy bears wearing T-shirts with Father Christmas printed on. Some teddy bears sing a song or play a tune. A Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is another themed baby Christmas gift. 

My First Christmas Keepsake boxes are great for storing cards and other family mementoes. There are also boxes to keep baby's first hair curl or tooth. Baby can have his or her own stocking with their name on it. Pewter mugs and breakfast and dinner crockery sets are popular too. Sterling silver keepsake spoons or photograph albums or photograph frames are another baby Christmas gift idea. Relatives or friends may want to buy baby a bible or scripture book.

Some more unconventional presents are gaining in popularity. These are not ones that baby can unwrap but they do last a lifetime. For a memorable baby Christmas gift, there are companies that sell an acre of land on the moon or Venus. The gift contains a deed certificate and a property map showing the location of the land and detailing the mineral rights. In similar fashion, it is possible to name a star in honor of the new arrival. This comes with a presentation box, containing a certificate with the star's name, a sky chart and a star plotter. For a more down to earth present, there is a dedicate a tree gift pack and baby helps conservation by having a tree planted in his or her name.
