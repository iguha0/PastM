Advertising Jobs

When looking for a job, it's necessary to buy newspapers, browse the web and register with agencies. All this is time consuming and takes up a lot of energy, especially if you already have a job and are looking for another one. It would help the process if companies thought about making the art of advertising jobs more user friendly. I have seen vacancies that don't give information on payment. When I ring them to ask about this little detail, I am often told that this information cannot be given over the phone and I will be informed at the interview. I stopped going to these interviews because the wage turns out to be a joke. That's why they don't want to tell you in the first place. It's a complete waste of time for the applicant and the interviewer. Why can't they just be up front about it and you can decide if it's worth your while?

The offer of money can be a bit vague. Some vacancies state that that there is no compensation but it may be offered later when the circumstances permit. When is this likely to happen, you wonder? When I am old and gray? Advertising jobs should involve as much specific information as possible, in order to make an informed choice as to whether to apply or not.

At least, some decent legislation has taken force. Of course, it's illegal to ask for a certain gender, race or religion except in special situations, which are exempt. In the UK, a law is about to be passed that outlaws ageism when advertising jobs. This is a good thing in principle and will certainly help people over forty or fifty years old. Too often, they are confined to the scrap heap. Application forms will no longer ask for a date of birth. However, some companies are getting into a panic as to the interpretation of the Bill. No one seems sure if they will still be able to ask for people with experience or qualifications. Levels of experience and qualifications denote a rough estimate of someone's age. I think it would be absurd for the law to be as pedantic as this. After all, you don't want a sixteen year old applying for a job as a brain surgeon just because he can. Some offices have even banned birthday cards with ages on, in case an employee feels intimidated.

There needs to be common sense applied to all these issues. There should be fair conditions surrounding advertising jobs for the bosses and the job seekers. A lot of time is wasted in the process, which is why so many employers hire the services of agencies to do the screening.
