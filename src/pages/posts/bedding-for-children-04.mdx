Buying my children bedding is one of my favorite things to do. You might think that I'm crazy, but it really is a lot of fun. It is not that I am so into the idea of spending a lot of money on bedroom ideas for children. I know that beds and bedding for children are pretty spendy, particularly because they have to be replaced so often as the kids continue to grow. Nonetheless, it is a sacrifice that I am willing to make. You see, helping your child to set up his or her bedroom can be a great bonding activity for any parent.

A lot of parents are too pragmatic about their kids bedrooms. They will buy  bedding for children when they see it on sale, buy whatever cheap posters they think the kid will like, and bring in whatever old bed happens to be already sitting there, abandoned by an older child. I have a different approach to parenting. I believe that everything you do with your kids should be, if possible, both an exercise in learning, and an exercise in fun.

That is why, when I am shopping for bedding for children, I make it a big production. Rather than just going out and picking out some sheets and blankets, we design the whole room together. For the kids, this is a great activity in a few ways. It gives them the opportunity to express themselves creatively, makes them feel more in control of their environments, and helps build spacial reasoning skills. Of course, it does cost quite a bit more to decorate a kids bedroom in a theme, but it is worth it! All in all, it is a much more rewarding and educational experience than simply buying your kid some sheets and a blanket.

Of course, you do have to set out some ground rules before picking out the bedding for children. Your kid has to be willing to stick with a certain look for at least 6 months or a year. You do not want to be buying, say, canopy beds for kids one week and then, the next week, have to buy a whole new bed when they change their minds. This can help teach responsibility. Your kid has to learn how to stick with his decision and take responsibility. That way, he will grow up knowing that careful decision making is important.
