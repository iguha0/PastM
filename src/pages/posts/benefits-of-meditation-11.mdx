Benefits of Meditation

The psychological benefits of meditation are many; researchers and doctors all over the world are realizing just how powerful the psychological and physical benefits can be. With stressful jobs, family responsibilities, and a never ending list of things that need to be done. According to Psychology Today, at www.psychologytoday.com, neuroscientists have found that brain waves of meditators show they are healthier than their non-meditating counterparts both physically and mentally. Meditation can help people feel less anxious and more in control of their lives, which all of us could use a bit of, I’m sure. Numerous sources state that when practiced routinely, the meditative state can lead to supreme bliss or enlightenment, which is the desired natural spiritual outcome of the practice of yoga and meditation.

As mentioned above, the benefits of meditation are many, and there are lots of internet resources available to those who would like to reach a new level of self awareness. According to one of these sources, www.healthandyoga.com, in addition to improving general health and well being, regular meditation increases blood flow to different parts of the body, therefore increasing oxygen and other nutrients available at the cellular level, which also increases concentration. Just some of the health benefits of meditation include lower oxygen consumption, lower respiratory rate, slower heart rate, lower blood pressure, reduced anxiety, decreased muscle tension and headaches, and increased serotonin production which influences mood and behavior. Lower levels of this neurotransmitter are associated with depression, obesity, insomnia, and headaches. Benefits of meditation also include enhanced immune system function; research has shown that the activity of natural killer cells increased with routine meditation, which kills bacteria and cancer cells, reducing activity of viruses and emotional distress. 

For more information of the benefits of meditation visit any number of sites devoted to the practice. In addition to the sites mentioned previously, www.abc-of-yoga.com, www.healing.about.com, and www.1stholistic.com all have lots of great information on the subject.

You don’t need a bunch of fancy equipment to get started on your path to self awareness and enlightenment, just a nice quiet place when you can relax and focus inward on eliminating negative energies and bringing forth everything positive instead. Incense and relaxing music add to the perfect ambience in a quiet dark comfortable space, where you can leave all the baggage behind and get back in touch with the real you. Not all of the benefits of meditation can truly be explained, as they are different for everyone on various levels. Give it a try, discover yourself.
