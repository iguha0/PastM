Smoking is BAD! Is there still a living soul that doesn't know and understand this? There can't be. The media won't let such a thing happen. Just take a gander at all the anti-smoking commercials aired daily. If they don't get the point across, nothing will. As we all know, smoking leads to lung cancer. It's not exclusively for those with poor genetics or smokers over the age of 65. It can apply to anyone who lights up regularly. One measly cigarette will taint your lungs for a full month. Imagine what a pack a day will do to them. We're talking some serious damage here. So, if you're still on the fence about smoking, I think it's time for a few recent articles on lung cancer. 

I love to read. Not just novels and the Sunday paper. I mean I really like to read and learn about new things. It's refreshing and I need to know what's happening in the world today. If it's not articles on lung cancer, its break-throughs regarding heart disease or prostate enlargement. It's always prudent to add new data to the brain banks. This way you don't wander through life like a naive, uninformed dolt. You prevent things before they occur, and you seek the newest medications upon the detection of a health affliction. With some health issues, it's pretty cut and dry. One would think that common sense would overrule, but apparently it doesn't. If it did, folks wouldn't still be smoking like chimneys. Some individuals just need a scare before they can get on the smoke-free bandwagon. If current articles on lung cancer won't do the trick, maybe respiratory problems will. 

One of the most amusing things I've ever seen is a person smoking through the hole cut out of their throat. Now that's bright! Obviously some people have a horrible time kicking the habit. However, there is irrefutable evidence linking smoking to serious health afflictions. Any articles on lung cancer, asthma and Bronchitis can inform you of this. We need to work toward a smoke-free environment, because all the rest of us are being assaulted by the second-hand stuff. That's not right! Kick the habit before it kicks you off the primordial coil.
