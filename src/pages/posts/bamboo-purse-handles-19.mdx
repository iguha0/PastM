I have a great relationship with my sisters and my sister-in-laws. Each year I spend a weekend with my sisters and one with the in-laws. They have become traditions. We take turns planning them and try to go to different places and events. We leave early on a Saturday morning and return early evening on Sunday. We bring along wine to have in the hotel room so we can sit and visit and then we go out for dinner in the evening. Sometimes we stay at casinos and other times we will stay in a resort area. We spend most of the day Saturday shopping. 

When we shop in the stores that have different gift items or crafts we are always saying, we could make that. My sisters and I laugh about this because we never follow through with making any of the things that we have seen. My sister-in-law on the other hand will go home the next day and will make something we saw on our outing. Last year we saw knitted bags. They had bamboo purse handles and were available in a variety of colors. They were very cute, but quite expensive. My sister-in-law loves to knit. She thought they would be easy to make but she did not know where she could find the bamboo purse handles. Over lunch we talked about alternatives she could use in place of the bamboo purse handles. I suggested just knitting a handle, but she was concerned that it would stretch too much, especially on a larger bag. We decided that after lunch we would look for a craft store to see if we could find the handles made of bamboo or some other handles that she could use in place of them.

The first store had wooden handles that were cute, however they were quite short. The sales person suggested we try another large store that carried more craft items. In this store we found a wide selection of bamboo purse handles in different sizes and colors. Some of the handles had been dyed in a wide selection of colors and others had been stained. The bigger hoops could be used for a shoulder bag. The handles were not very expensive so she bought a variety of sizes and colors so she could experiment with different bags. Since that time she has made a great many of the bags. She now orders the handles from a site off the internet because she has an even bigger selection and gets them delivered to her door.
