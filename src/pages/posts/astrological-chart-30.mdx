Many people go looking for an astrological chart in order to better understand themselves. Some want rationalization from the stars so that they can justify some particular aspect of their personality. Like most people, I was a huge skeptic when it came to astrology and the validity of my own astrological chart. I think it is always a good idea to retain a healthy level of skepticism when it comes to things that cannot easily be proven. I do not believe that there is any science evident in an astrological chart but I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the accuracy of my chart.

Once upon a time, I rented a small house from an old hippie. He was a very eccentric man and asked everyone he met about their birth date. When my birthday rolled around he showed up at my front door with a manila envelope for me with the words “Happy Birthday” written on the front. Inside was an astrological chart personally prepared for me by my landlord.

When I had the time, I sat down with the astrological chart and read the explanations that my landlord had attached to it. I was definitely shocked by the personality traits that it was correct about. Before seeing my own astrological chart I thought that astrology basically claimed that everyone who shared a sign was pretty much the same. After looking at my astrological chart I found that there were numerous pieces of information taken into account when preparing the chart.

The day I was born was very important but so was the place on earth that I was born and the time of day. I began to see that there were dozens of levels to the astrological chart and all of them were connected. I am not saying that I believe that looking at your astrological chart will unlock your personal mysteries, but at the very least, it is interesting. Each aspect of the chart is related to the others and those that have clear relationships are shown with geometric figures in the center of the chart. My astrological chart had squares and triangles in different colors all through the middle to show me which elements interacted with each other.

All in all, I think that having an astrological chart drawn up for someone is a cute and intriguing birthday gift. Just remember that people may think you are a bit batty. To be honest, finding out that my old landlord was in the astrology business did not help his case at all!
