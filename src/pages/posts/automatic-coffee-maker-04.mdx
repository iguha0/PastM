When I first got my automatic coffee maker, I thought that was it. I seems that, from then on, I would be able to brew the perfect cup of coffee without any effort at all. My automatic drip coffee maker, after all, would be able to handle the details. All I would have to do was to supply coffee. For several months, I was pretty happy with the way it worked. I was get a pretty good cup of coffee, but it was never quite right. I didn't even notice for a while, to tell you the truth, until I went over to a friends house to have a cup of his.

We had the same automatic coffee makers, but the cups that they brewed were quite different. Part of it had to do with the coffee that we put in the automatic coffee maker. His was a slightly higher grade blend, so I assumed that was the difference. I asked him what kind of coffee he was using, and he told me. I went out and bought it the next day, excited to try it. I put it in my automatic coffee maker, and waited for the magic to happen. It was good, but it was not as good as the coffee I had over at my friend's house. I couldn't figure out the difference. It felt like my automatic coffee maker had failed me.

I didn't want to ask him what his secret was. It seemed like I had failed if I couldn't figure out how to use a coffee maker automatic on my own. I experimented with different settings. I set the automatic coffeemaker to drip more slowly, to drip faster, and to use hotter and cooler water. I even tried adding cardamom and shaved chocolate. Nothing seemed to do the trick. The automatic coffee maker still didn't make the same perfect cup I had had at my friend's house.

Finally, in frustration, I asked him what it was that he did differently. He told me. It was quite simple really,  and I wished that I had asked earlier and saved myself the frustration. He roasted his own coffee. That was all there was to it. No matter whether you are using an antique coffee maker or an automatic one, fresh roasted coffee always tastes better. When he explained it, I decided to roast my own. It really is great when you prepare it yourself!
