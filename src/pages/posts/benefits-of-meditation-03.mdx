We all need to work to stay healthy. This is no great mystery. If you're not in the diet and fitness loop by now, then you've been certainly living beneath a rock. Now, there are many ways to stay healthy and physically fit. Maybe you already embrace a few of them. Or, just maybe you're one of those health nuts who embrace the entire lifestyle. You know, the whole "my body is a shrine spiel." Either way, you're on the right track to a healthier and happier you. This is such a process because it's never ending. You must adopt good habits and keep them. Don't discard them once you achieved a 20 pound goal weight loss. You'll be sorry, because it will just come right back. Get the picture? Okay, now what about the benefits of meditation and yoga? Are you aware of these concepts? If not, it's time to get the skinny. 

When I was a child, I made fun of meditation. I thought it was complete and utter garbage. Kind of like the Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy. But, then I saw that flick "Darkness Falls" about the evil Tooth Fairy and had a change of heart. If that can be real, then so can the benefits of meditation. Make any sense? I didn't think it would. But really, when I was about 23 years old, I began dabbling in meditation. I was in a Wing Chun kung fu class and the sifu(teacher) knew all about it. You see, this is common amongst traditional martial arts instructors. They are often healers as well as fighters. It just goes with the territory of knowing and understanding your body. So I was basically taught the basics of meditation. It's a time when you can relax, and drift off somewhere safe. Your worries, stresses and troubles diminish as you become one with your spiritual side. Sound cool? This is where the benefits of meditation come into play. When your body is relaxed and free from routine torments, it relaxes and aids your muscles and mind. This can definitely leave you feeling refreshed and ready to function easier in the world around you.
