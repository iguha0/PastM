Abdominal Pain

There aren’t many times when you will have abdominal pain in your life when there is nothing wrong. Having an upset stomach is one thing, but having sharp types of pain in any region of the abdomen probably means that there is something wrong and you need to see a physician. There are many things that could be wrong, and it will be up to your doctor to decide if it is a serious problem. You may find that you have to have surgery as soon as possible. That will not always be the case, of course, but you should make sure anything that bothers you is not ignored.

One of the main reasons why you may get abdominal pain would be from your appendix. If this happens to you, you will need medical attention as soon as possible. In fact, if you show up with abdominal pain that will be one of the first things your doctor will look at to determine if you need to get medical attention right away. It may require surgery. Your pain may not signal a problem with your appendix, but it is always something that should be checked out as soon as possible.

Another common form of abdominal pain or discomfort comes from a woman’s monthly cycle. Though most women know the difference between the pain in or near the stomach area and the reproductive area, when a young girl first starts to experience her cycles she may not know the difference. If your daughter is complaining of abdominal pain, you want to make sure she can pin point where it is coming from before you rush her in to the emergency room.

Abdominal pain can come from many other different things, but you should always make sure that anything that lasts longer than a few hours is checked out by a doctor. Make sure that you note any other symptoms you may be having along with your abdominal pain like lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or anything else you may be experiencing. This will help anyone offering you medical assistance an insight as to what you may be having a problem with, and this can speed up diagnosis. Also remember that if you have had any surgeries or medical problems within the last few years that you should mention that to your doctor, along with an special medical conditions that you may have as well.
