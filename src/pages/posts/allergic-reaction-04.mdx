Today, allergic reactions seem to be everywhere. Turn on the television and you are likely to see ads for decongestants and antihistamines meant to treat allergy symptoms. Go to the drug store and you will see pills for seasonal allergies, creams for allergic skin reactions, and even new age treatments to desensitize you from your allergies. Allergy shots are big with kids nowadays, with more families than ever taking their kids in to get immunized. And yet there are still a lot of people who do not really get what lies behind an  allergic reaction. Rather than get to the root causes, they simply pop pills. It is, of course, easier, but is it really the best treatment?

Until recently, not many people understood how complex allergies could be. In some ways, an allergic reaction is a pretty simple even. Basically, you get an allergy attack when the body mistakes something that should be harmless for an intruder. It causes inflammation, fighting whatever food allergen, plant allergen, or what have you. This makes you feel sick. In spite of this seeming simplicity, however, allergic reactions are actually pretty complex. There is a lot more going on than most people know about.

For example, did you know that, even if you do not have any food allergies, the food that you eat can make you more vulnerable to an allergic reaction? Up until a few years ago, doctors did not really get how much of a role diet played in allergies. As a matter of fact, they are still learning about it! Apparently, eating a lot of fatty, processed food can make respiratory allergies worse. These foods cause inflammation, making the body more sensitive to common allergens. It is true that you can treat an allergic reaction by taking a Claritin, but in the long run, you might be better off eating better. It will do more for your health than most antihistamines.

Of course, for a severe allergic reaction, it is important to get proper treatment. If you have food allergies, you have to completely avoid those foods at all costs. If, on the other hand, you have environmental allergies, it might make sense for you to get shots. An activated carbon air filter can help too. After all, if you let the allergies get out of control, they will be a lot harder to treat. Treatment, combined with proper diet, can work wonders.
