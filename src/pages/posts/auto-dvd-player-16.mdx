Anyone who has every traveled a long distance with children in a vehicle knows the benefits of an auto DVD player. These handy devices can make a possible nightmare on the road into an enjoyable ride that can last for hours without a major meltdown from the backseat passengers. There are some great options in auto DVD players.

You might think that such a valuable piece of technology would cost a bundle but you can find an auto DVD player at a really reasonable price. I was thrilled to discover this very fact when I was shopping for a way to keep the kids entertained on long trips. I have twin toddlers and they can wreak havoc on a long trip.

I learned about the difficulty of traveling with two toddlers on a long trip after a horrendous summer vacation. We had a long distance to cover but I really thought that the large family van would be spacious enough to house the four of us and I really believed that entertainment would be provided by the scenery.

Unfortunately, toddlers are not so thrilled about great landscapes. The twins were absolutely miserable during the entire drive and it was difficult to console them even when we made pit stops. Basically, without an auto DVD player to keep the little ones occupied, we had nothing but tears and screams drilling us from the back seats.

By the time we reached the vacation destination all four of us were exhausted. Unfortunately, the first day was engulfed in the nasty travel experience. Even though we only spent six hours in the car, it felt like we had spent an entire week in there. The rest of the day was spent trying to unwind from the awful travel experience.

The ride home was not any better. I couldn’t imagine a worse driving experience. After this trip I decided that we were never going to take another trip like that again. I knew that an auto DVD player would make all the difference for our family on long trips. 

Finding the right unit for our vehicle was no problem at all. From now on I make sure to have a full stock of my kids’ favorite shows on hand when we have to travel any long distance. The auto DVD player was an excellent investment. We love ours so much that we are looking to buy a new vehicle that comes equipped with one.
