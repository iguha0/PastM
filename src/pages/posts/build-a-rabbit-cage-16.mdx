A new pet is an exciting thing especially when the pet is soft and adorable. Many people love adopting bunnies for their home and some even like to build a rabbit cage to welcome the new member of the family. Choosing to create a living space for your pet is a great way to bond with the animal.

The first thing that you want to do is consider how much room you are willing to use for the project. When you build a rabbit cage you make a special area for the animal. Many believe that the bigger the area is, the better it is for the pet. There are some things to consider before choosing a size that is right for your bunny.

You might want to build a rabbit cage according to the number of hours the pet will spend in there during a day. Some people let their house trained rabbits run loose for a significant period of time while others like to keep them in their cages for most of the day. You really want to let the pet out for awhile during twilight time and during the dawn hours. This is when the animals are most active. 

If you are going to have your pet in its home for the majority of the time you may want to consider this when you build a rabbit cage for the animal. As a general rule, you want to make the cage at least four times bigger than the bunny. However, you want to build a rabbit cage that is even larger than that if the pet will be spending most of its time in the area. 

Some designs offer two-story cages that are connected with a ramp. Bunnies love the ability to see things from different points of view and the ramp allows them to get a lot of exercise as well. This is ideal for any bunny even if he doesn’t spend all of his time in the unit.

The floor of the cage should not be made of wire because it is hard on the rabbit’s feet. When you build a rabbit cage it should have plastic or wooden floors. Include a nice place for the animal’s litter box so the animal always goes to the same spot. You can add some details after you build a rabbit cage that makes the area extra special as well.

Adding elements like toys and wooden baseboards is a great way to keep your bunny happy. When you build a rabbit cage you build a house for your pet. Little details can make that house a home.
