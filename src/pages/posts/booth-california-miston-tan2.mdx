The spray tanning booth is the best answer for those people seeking the quickest and safest bronzing of their skin. However, you must also remember that you should not rely on the application to protect your skin from the sun rays too. If going out and exposure to sunlight is unavoidable, you must wear a sunscreen at least 15 times the sun protection. Remember your tanned glow is natural so it can get burned from the UV rays.
