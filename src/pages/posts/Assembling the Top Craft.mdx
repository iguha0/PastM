Assembling the Top Craft 

Wall hangers are easy to create. The minute size quilts once created will make a nice gift and/or decoration for your home. 

Once you have your parts together, as well as have your tools you can get started making a wall hanger. If you are new to quilting, do not worry since the hanger we are making is one of the easier groups of craft to create. 

Do not forget to get your rotary cutters on hand, since throughout your quilting project you will need to cut ¼-inch allowances for your seams. Now, assuming you have your green, tan, blue, yellow, and peach print in order we can get started making your top section of the quilt. 

Briefly, I will go over the sections to help you prepare. You should have two, 2 ½ x 19 ½ inches of upper and lower borders in the green prints. You should have another two borders in green at the size of 2 ½ x 27 ½ inches. You should have the value of 36 for your D Square and the size at 1 ½ x 1 ½ inches. Tan print has six parts, i.e. A-strip, B piece, C-Strip, D-E square, and F-strip. Blue only has one part, while yellow has three and peach has one. The yellow is C-strip, D-square, and the last value of four is the cornerstone. C values eighteen, and measures at 1 ½ x 1 ½ inches, while D values 12 and measures at 2 ½ x 2 ½ inches; F is the peach strip, Peach, which values four and its gauge is 1 ½ x 3 ½ inches. Peach has the G-strip, which values four and measures at 2 ½ x 5 ½ inches. The rust prints include the value of six, which makes up the sashing #1 vertical at measures to 1 ½ x 13 ½ inches. The second sashing creates three and measures to 1 ½ x 21 ½ inches, while the last H strip values four and measures at 1 ½ x 7 ½ inches. 

You will need to cut these pieces of your quilt out. Use the guide above to achieve a precise cut. Now you can crown your quilt. Start by creating a row and a block. Use your block, row, and begin stitching your D-Blue Square to attach to the A-Tan narrow pieces. (Strips) 

Continue to the next color arrangement to complete the second block. Use the D-Yellow Square in the second block and create a couple of narrow pieces per color arrangement. 

Now stitch two pieces of the tan print together to create a starting row two and in the first block. Use Tan B, a couple of Blue Cs, a Yellow C and overturn so that the yellow/blue has a gateway through the color arrangement at the second block. You want to create double narrow pieces. 

In the third row, create a couple more rows and arrange the colors according in the blocks. In the fourth row, create another two rows so that you have a nine pattern in your color arrangement, which should extend crosswise. Alternating, add stitches to the blocks (2) and make your center by creating #2 sashing narrow pieces equaling three. Now press your fabric. Use an iron without ironing, rather pressing as you move along. 

You are ready for your borders. Starting with the #2 border, stitch the narrow pieces so that it moves left to right, and to the sides at the right of your quilt, stitching toward the middle. Add 2 ½ x 2 ½ inches, by stitching the yellow print square. Stitch along the shorter ends linking it to your dual borders. (Strip #1) Moving along, at the edges along the top and bottom, stitch the narrow pieces, stitching along the middle. You are now ready to complete your project.
