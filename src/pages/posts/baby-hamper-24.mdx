There are many things you have to buy for your baby’s new nursery, and some are easier to choose than others. When you buy a crib and changing table, you have to think about recalls, heights, and often safety issues. When buying smaller things, you do want to worry about sharp corners and things that might tip over, but the choices are much easier to make. Things like end tables and baby hampers have to be safe, but they can be where you add color to your new room.

You don’t want to skip the end table or the baby hamper when fixing up your new nursery. The table will be needed for you to set any number of things down, especially when you are breastfeeding in the middle of the night. If you bottle feed, you are really going to need a spot to set random things so you don’t disturb a baby that just fell asleep after a feeding. The baby hamper is going to be used for clothes, obviously, but this is something that will stay with baby for a long time to come.

In my own experience, the baby hamper is something you should buy with sturdiness in mind. You don’t want something too heavy, but you do want something that will last. There is one very good reason for this. That baby hamper will end up being so much more than a hamper to your child. I don’t think all children will find delight in tearing the clothes out of one, but most will. This is one of the ways they explore the world, and it is bound to happen at least once.

After that happens, the baby hamper may also become a place for scary toys. This is something my daughter did. She was scared of the eyes on a few of her toys, and the baby hamper she has was the perfect place to hide them while she slept. Through the last few years, that hamper has stayed with her as a hiding spot (and many other things) while most of the rest of her nursery items were replaced with something else. A hamper might seem simple enough, but in the eyes of a child, it is so much more than just a place for dirty clothes. Buy something sturdy, and something that will last so you aren’t replacing it time and time again.
