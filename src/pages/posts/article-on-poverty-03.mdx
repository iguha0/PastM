There are many touchy issues and subjects in our society. Anything from abortion, to euthanasia, to mental illness, to disease are spoken about regularly in the media. However, one of the largest issues doesn't seem to come up as much. I'm talking about poverty. This is a major concern in the world we currently live in. I definitely think it deserves plenty of attention. I think it's one of those topics that make people uncomfortable; therefore they struggle to avoid it. Typically those who suffer from poverty are embarrassed by the fact, while the rich folks strive to act like it doesn't exist. This is called the easy way out. Just pretend it's not there. Hopefully it will go away or stay suppressed somewhere. Yeah, not likely to happen. Have you read a recent article on poverty lately? It's not really improving. Maybe everyone should just wake up. 

What comes to mind when you hear the word "capital?" For me it's our household income. I usually ponder the money my wife and I bring in to pay the bills and stay afloat. I would assume many individuals think the same thing, or at least somewhere in that vicinity. Now, what about the notion of "poverty?" This probably stirs different thoughts. I know that it does with me. My mind usually refers back to those commercials you see on television. You know the ones that depict the hungry children with no homes, and someone telling you what 10 cents a day could do. It's depressing to say the least. However, whenever my father would see these, he would always say "We need to take care of the poverty-stricken families in our country first." I guess that makes sense. After reviewing an article on poverty in America, there is definitely problem at-hand. I can't dispute that. So, what about the financially endowed? I mean come on; there are folks out there who truly need to read an article on poverty. Look at Donald Trump and Bill Gates. Instead of hording all that cash; why not give half to charity? They'd still be rich and they will have helped so many. Makes sense to me. 

If you're looking for a current article on poverty, you won't have to search far. These babies are a dime a dozen. Hop on the web and take a surf. Check out what's going on right under your nose. That article on poverty may just change your life.
