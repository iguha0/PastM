Our society is getting faster paced with each passing year. We are all looking for ways to help us complete the things that we need to do in the shortest time possible so that we can have additional time to have for ourselves. This can get us into trouble if doing things fast means that mistakes are made. When this happens we spend additional time correcting mistakes. This can create a vicious cycle. There are times when we simply need to slow things down.

One of the best things that we can do to help ourselves is to become more organized. Organization can help us manage our time better. There are many benefits of time management. We can be more productive as well as more efficient. When we are more efficient we save time and money. Other benefits of time management involve helping the company you work for save money. This creates a happy employer and when this reflects back to you, it may mean additional compensation in money or time off.

I think all of us release the benefits of time management, but implementing the skills may be something new to us. I have found that lists work well for me. When I make lists at the beginning of each day I find I am more apt to get the things done that are needed. My routine each morning is to write down the things that I would like to as well as need to accomplish that day. I then prioritize the list in order of what is most important to accomplish. Once this is done I look at any related tasks that can be done in conjunction with each other. For example if I need to meet with a co-worker on a different floor and also deliver reports to another department I will do this at the same time. This way I am away from my desk for one period of time thus cutting down on the amount of running around I need to do. I also do as much correspondence at one time as possible to limit the number of trips to the printer, copier and mail room. Multiple trips uses up time. Also I find when I am out and about away from my office I spend time greeting co-worker and doing other things that can eat away at my time.

Once my list is written and prioritized I begin with the top item and start working my way down. If I am on a tight schedule I limit the number of interruptions by putting my calls through to voice mail to answer later and also shut my office door. What ever is not completed on my list by the end of the day gets added to the list for the next day. Some of these techniques may seem rigid, however the benefits of this time management pay off by getting things done and creating more time by the end of the week. Since I have been doing my work following these methods I find that I am often able to leave early at the end of the week.
