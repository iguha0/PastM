When you have a backyard barbecue, what are some of the first thoughts that come to mind? Friends, meat, wonderful aromas, lots of fun and, of course, barbecue sauce. This delicious sauce has been an American favorite for outdoor cook-outs since 1948 when Heinz first came up with it's signature barbecue sauce. The condiment actually dates back to the 1600's, when some inventive soul discovered that the vinegar and tomato-based concoction, laden with sufficient spices, covered a panoply of unattractive and unhealthful problems with spoiled meat, while adding a zesty flavor.

Today, barbecue sauces come in many textures ranging from a runny liquid to sumptuously thick. Some barbecue “purist” gourmets look down on the addition of any external flavorings, but a glance at the grocery aisle offerings of available barbecue sauces attests that there are many people who disagree. There are barbecue sauce recipes flavored with fruit, ginger, cayenne, habaneros, chipotle peppers, teriyaki and a host of others.

A barbecue sauce should be complementary to what you're cooking and how you're cooking it. Most commonly used on beef, pork and chicken, barbecue sauce can also be used to brush fruit kabobs, dip fries,  and even as a marinade. The cooking method also plays a role in the barbecue sauce recipe that you choose. Baking a meat in the oven only requires a thin coating of sauce, so that it will caramelize without burning. Some grilling enthusiasts swear by a thick sauce for grilling. Application time is critical in achieving the perfectly flavored barbecue dish.  When baking, the condiment should be applied mid-way through the cooking time. With grilling, it should be brushed on, but lightly, throughout cooking for a thick, caramelized coating. Now that you've got a grip on your brush and know how and when to apply the garnish, let's move on to your barbecue sauce recipe. 

The basic ingredients in a barbecue sauce recipe are tomato sauce, a sweetener, spices, and vinegar. This basic list is for only the most unsophisticated of barbecue sauce recipes. Before you begin making your own barbecue sauce recipe, try several types of commercial sauces to get an idea of tastes you'd like to experiment with in your own kitchen creations.

Fruit flavored recipes are best with chicken, fish and kabobs. Shrimp and pork are especially complimented with tangy glaze sauces, such as apple, peach, and pineapple flavors. If these sauces are a bit tame for your taste, then try some hot and spicy barbecue sauce recipes. Chipotle, teriyaki, and habanero are all excellent additions to almost any meat. 

The perfect barbecue sauce recipe is the one you, your family and friends love best! There are so many out there, you owe it to your taste buds to experiment. Who knows but that when you've sampled them all, you may find the only sauce for you is the original.
