You might have a hard time finding anyone who will not have some glimmer of recognition if you say the names Barbie and Ken. Most little girls love dolls, and if they did not have these two on their own, they probably had at least one friend that did. These dolls have been around for a long time, and have been subject to all types of different ideas. Some parents love them, some are indifferent, and some say they are a symbol of all that is wrong with the world today.

For me, Barbie and Ken are harmless, but I can understand why some parents don’t like them. Barbie does have a shape no woman can hope to have in her lifetime, but I’m not sure many girls are thinking about that. It might put an idea into her mind about what shape she should have when she grows up, but looking just like her is not something most will think about. Those who do many have other issues that contribute to the problem. Blaming Barbie and Ken might be a bit of a stretch.

What I have always liked about Barbie and Ken is that they can be anything that you want them to be. Barbie has had many great careers, and she does show that you don’t have to settle for being anything you don’t want to be. Ken has also had some great jobs, and he and Barbie have shared a life while both have worked. Those simple ideas are great ones as far as I am concerned. The world has changed, and though some woman prefer to stay home, not all of them can even if they wanted to. In many cases, two income families are the norm because that is what they need to do to pay the bills.

If you are concerned about what Barbie and Ken might portray to your child, all you have to do is to talk to them about the dolls. Ask them why they like them, and what they think of them. You might be surprised at what you hear. If you end up hearing something you don’t like, you have a golden opportunity to talk to your child about whatever it is that bothers you. Toys like Barbie and Ken are great, but what you say as a parent is what is going to stick with them. Sometimes it seems as if the children aren’t listening, but they are hearing far more than you could imagine.
