It's no big secret that every individual does not want to go to college. This is not the end of the world by any means. After all, college does not equal success. You have to be driven to succeed in this world. Maybe that involves a higher education and maybe it doesn't. It's all up to you. My closest friend never went to college, and yet he managed to start his own business, which makes him loads of money on a regular basis. The trick is finding out what you want to do and then assess the situation. What are you going to need to get to that point where you want to be? Maybe it involves associates degrees. Have you ever considered this option? So many careers now days can be acquired after achieving associates degrees. 

I first learned of associates degrees back when I was in high school. My older brother was working on his senior year and attending a junior college at the same time. This was a smart plan. He was getting some of that higher education out of the way while he was still in high school. I know this is a route that many folks would avoid, but it turned out nicely for him. If you didn't already know, most associates degrees only take around two years to complete. Now, that may sound a bit better to you than a four year spread. How long did you want to go to school? My wife actually did both. She first acquired her associates degree from a community college and then transferred to a University to attain her B.S. in chemical engineering. 

The best place to begin your research on associates degrees is the web. Browse for current career options in whatever field you find interesting and enjoyable. My brother has done very well with his associates degree in computers. He works as a technician for a high-end University and loves it. The benefits he gets are phenomenal. Sometimes I just can't believe it. It's hardly fair if you ask me. Furthermore he earns a wonderful income. There's no reason why you can't do the same with an associates degree. Check out the community college in your area to see what programs they offer regarding contemporary associates degrees.
