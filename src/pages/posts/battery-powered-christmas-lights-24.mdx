Each year we always have the same problem. There are simply not enough sockets in which to plug in our Christmas tree lights. This means we have to be creative with extension cords and power surge strips, and that is not always something that I feel comfortable with doing. I always thought there had to be a better way to handle the problem, and in fact, there was. My friend introduced me to the battery powered Christmas lights, and I have gotten quite a few strands of them since that time.

You do have to worry about battery life when you are going to use battery powered Christmas lights, but you certainly don’t have to worry about where to plug them in, and you don’t have to worry about having cords running all over the place. This can cut down some on your fire hazard, as well as the trip and fall that might just happen. If you have children or pets, these are both things that should be on your mind. If you can make things a little safer by going with the Christmas lights that are battery powered, you have a few less worries around the holidays.

Another great benefit of using battery powered Christmas lights is that they don’t have to be limited by where you plug them in. If you want to have lights going around the perimeter of your ceiling, you can do so without having to have a cord running down to a power source. That can make your decorating much sleeker, and a whole lot neater. This means you can hang them anywhere in the house, even along the stairs where no source of power might be found in your home. The batteries make them extremely portable and versatile.

Even better, you can use battery powered Christmas lights outside your home where sources of electric are even more scarce. You can hang them anywhere you like, but you do have to worry about getting the right type of lights. You should always check to be sure they are outdoor lights, or they are going to break or short out the first time it rains, shows, or drops below freezing. They could also be a fire hazard if on a tree or your home, but they are not meant to be out in the weather. These battery powered lights are great to have, but only if they are safe.
